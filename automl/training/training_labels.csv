mr. speaker  i rise for a constitutional point of order .,Democratic
mr. speaker  consistent with the oath of office that i just took  i would request that the question of consideration be put to the body .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the resolution we are preparing to consider  the proposed rules for the 109th congress  in my judgment violates the united states constitution which we were just sworn to uphold and defend .,Democratic
it does so by allowing a very limited number of members  potentially only a handful  to constitute the house of representatives .,Democratic
article 1  section 5 of the constitution states that `` each house shall be the judge of the elections  returns and qualifications of its members  and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a small number adjourn from day to day  and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members.,Democratic
'' unfortunately  h. res.,Democratic
5 seeks to allow a small number not just to adjourn or compel attendance  as the constitution stipulates  but to enact laws  declare war  impeach the president  and fulfill all other article i responsibilities .,Democratic
the very first act of the very first congress of the united states was to recess day after day after day because they lacked a quorum .,Democratic
just moments ago everyone in this body took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution  and now our first official vote is by rule to undermine a fundamental principle of that constitution  i.e.  what is a quorum .,Democratic
it is my understanding that the speaker is reluctant to judge on matters of constitutionality .,Democratic
i respect that .,Democratic
but i would reserve and inform the speaker it is my intent to ask the question of consideration to be put .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the rules package that we have before us today .,Democratic
it is outrageous that my republican colleagues have placed before us a rules package that at best lacks integrity  and at worst is completely unethical .,Democratic
as the highest body of elected officials in our country  we should be held to the highest ethical standards .,Democratic
but instead  my republican colleagues have opted to put before us a rules package that actually lowers our ethics standards  so that they may promote their own agenda  at whatever cost .,Democratic
this rules package makes it far more difficult for ethics investigations to take place .,Democratic
by requiring a majority of the ethics committee before an investigation can even begin  we are in great danger of diminishing the integrity of our great institution .,Democratic
with this new rule  the majority party can effectively block any ethics investigation of a member of their party .,Democratic
this is an abuse of power .,Democratic
and it 's not just democrats who oppose this plan .,Democratic
americans across the country have expressed their opposition to this plan .,Democratic
my democratic colleagues and i have a better plan that will strengthen the ethics rules to improve congressional accountability and to make sure that legislation is properly considered .,Democratic
the republican plan fails to close a loophole that allows legislation to be considered before members have read it .,Democratic
last year this led to the passage of a provision that would have let the federal government deeply invade citizens ' privacy by reading their tax returns .,Democratic
i am appalled that the republicans have failed to include the democratic provision to tighten this loophole .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the resolution  so that we do not allow this rules package to become law .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process  changes of this magnitude can be made  as they were in 1997  only after thoughtful  careful consideration on a bipartisan basis .,Democratic
there has been no effort to look at the rules changes on ethics in a bipartisan manner .,Democratic
in 1997 when i co-chaired the committee on ethics reform along with bob livingston  the changes that we made were done after deliberation  and after democrats and republicans  working together  came before the house and we did make major changes .,Democratic
and we instituted the 45-day rule for assigning a proper complaint for investigation ; but we changed the rules in 1997 .,Democratic
we made it clear that you can move towards an informal investigation without a finding that it merits further inquiry or a resolution of preliminary inquiry because we did not want any matter of guilt or wrongdoing for the committee to be able to get the facts necessary to decide whether to go to formal investigation .,Democratic
yet this rules change which would allow after 45 days inaction to dismiss a complaint makes inaction action  and it can be done on a very partisan basis .,Democratic
now  that is wrong .,Democratic
that is not how it should be .,Democratic
the rules as they are currently configured in order to move a complaint past the committee  you have to have the bipartisan agreement of the committee because you have to have a vote in the committee .,Democratic
it guarantees a process will move forward in a bipartisan manner and  in fact  the committee on standards of official conduct has operated in a bipartisan manner because of the way the rules are configured .,Democratic
if this rule is changed  you are making it much more likely that the committee on standards of official conduct will act in a very partisan matter because they will be able to delay for 45 days  which does not take a lot of effort to figure out how to delay for 45 days .,Democratic
we have enough lawyers on the committee on standards of official conduct that will be able to figure out that one .,Democratic
and it will be done on a partisan basis that will leave a cloud on the member and a cloud on this institution .,Democratic
you should not have that in this rule .,Democratic
mr. speaker  as has been the case for a number of years  the rules package put forward by my republican colleagues continues to trample on the rights of the minority .,Democratic
it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices in this house such as the 3-hour vote on the medicare bill in the middle of the night .,Democratic
in fact  it allows the speaker added discretion to reconsider votes that the republican majority loses .,Democratic
in addition  the new rules require an affirmative vote by the ethics committee before any action can be taken .,Democratic
this  in effect  gives my republican colleagues the right to block any investigation .,Democratic
i would like to focus on one portion of the package that will create a permanent committee on homeland security .,Democratic
while i am sure some of my colleagues believe that the new committee will improve our security  unfortunately this new committee will be nothing more than a costly addition to the expenditures of the legislative branch  and it will likely breed a new wave of `` turf warfare '' among the committees of the house .,Democratic
we simply do not need a special committee every time we face a crisis .,Democratic
the process under which we are being asked to approve this change is particularly troublesome .,Democratic
i call your attention to the last time the house felt compelled to create a new committee .,Democratic
in 1980  some members of the house believed that it would be wise to create an energy committee .,Democratic
it used a careful process in which a committee on committees was created  consisting of democrats and republicans .,Democratic
when that committee reported its recommendations to the house  substitutes were permitted  and the result reflected a thoughtful understanding of how best to achieve the objectives .,Democratic
in contrast  we are now being asked to consider a proposal which was sent to us just yesterday .,Democratic
it was hatched in secret by our republican colleagues without the input of any democrats .,Democratic
while many of my democratic colleagues may agree with the need for a new committee  the right of the minority to have their views considered and voted upon has been trampled once again .,Democratic
i also oppose the notion that a new committee is needed .,Democratic
if the main concern is one of oversight  we can use our existing committees to do the job .,Democratic
if members still believed that a new committee was necessary  it need not have legislative jurisdiction .,Democratic
i am certain that is such a committee had legislative recommendations of merit  the appropriate committees along with proper actions by respective party leaders would ensure the bill would come to the floor .,Democratic
instead  i foresee a new committee that will seek to increase its powers by introducing bills granting all manner of new authorities to the department of homeland security .,Democratic
in addition  thoughtful bills addressing aspects of homeland security reported by the existing committees will now be delayed as the new committee will seek referrals .,Democratic
and needed responsiveness by the executive branch to the existing committees may be hindered .,Democratic
while the 9/11 commission urged a reorganization of congressional committees to deal with homeland security  it is odd that this new committee will have no jurisdiction over the issues that were identified by the commission that led to the 9/11 tragedy .,Democratic
the new committee will have no jurisdiction over the intelligence community  the law enforcement community  or immigration enforcement .,Democratic
it is a shame that the first day of this new congress should be marked by an attempt to authorize a new committee without so much as an open markup to consider its merits .,Democratic
moreover  it would be extremely unwise to ignore the expertise and experience of existing committees as we address homeland security issues  but we are starting down that path today .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Democratic
hefley ) xz4001740 for his presentation .,Democratic
we were told the president wants to proceed on a bipartisan fashion in the next 4 years to deal with the important issues that confront our nation .,Democratic
i think that is appropriate and  hopefully  we will do that .,Democratic
however  on this first day  the rules package is usually a partisan package .,Democratic
it was when democrats were in charge ; it is now when republicans are in charge .,Democratic
that is understandable .,Democratic
but as the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Democratic
hefley ) xz4001740 has so correctly pointed out  there was an exception  and that exception was dealing with the ethics of this institution which  in fact  deals with the confidence that the american public has in this institution .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the opening day of a new congress should be one in which the interests of this institution are paramount .,Democratic
the body of rules we adopt to govern debate  decorum  and the actions of our members should reflect that .,Democratic
to be sure  the american people who elected us to this great body can expect to see sharp differences on this floor over the substance of legislation .,Democratic
that is as the framers of the constitution planned .,Democratic
but the framers also intended  i believe  and the american people deserve to know  that this house is committed to holding its members to the highest ethical standards .,Democratic
today  as i think has been attested to by the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Democratic
hefley ) xz4001740  the house moves in the wrong direction .,Democratic
the rules proposed for the 109th house ignore the fundamental principle of protecting the ethics of this house .,Democratic
the proposed republican rules before us will seriously weaken the ability of the committee on standards of official conduct to enforce standards of integrity by providing that no action will be taken on a properly filed ethics complaint after 45 days unless the committee votes by a majority vote to take action .,Democratic
the gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Democratic
cardin ) xz4000640 will speak  who chaired with bob livingston  our former colleague  the amendment of these rules .,Democratic
under the current rules  which have functioned well since 1997  a properly filed complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member or the committee itself automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee .,Democratic
that is as it should be .,Democratic
inaction ought not to be tantamount to dismissal .,Democratic
that is what this proposal does .,Democratic
the republican proposal would make it extremely difficult to investigate properly filed complaints .,Democratic
under this new rule  either side  either side will be able to guarantee a deadlock when a legitimate  factually strong ethics complaint against a member is filed  provided the chair or ranking member take no action .,Democratic
we have been told that the most egregious attempts to weaken the ethics systems have been abandoned .,Democratic
i beg to differ .,Democratic
the most egregious attempt is the one before us now currently remaining in this rule .,Democratic
let no one miss this distinction : the proposal to protect an indicted leader  a proposal that has been withdrawn by the majority  always was speculative  because we do not know if a leader will be indicted .,Democratic
in sharp contrast  however  the rule before us will have a concrete  demonstrable effect on every ethics complaint filed from this day forward .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the committee on standards of official conduct is the only mechanism that this institution has to police itself .,Democratic
when we weaken the committee  we weaken the standards that we are all expected to uphold  and we erode public confidence in this institution .,Democratic
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
dreier ) xz4001150 spoke eloquently to the maintenance of the status quo when he was in the minority urging us to be vigilant in rooting out unethical behavior in this institution .,Democratic
he was right then .,Democratic
he is not correct now in offering this rule which weakens that process .,Democratic
the adoption of this rule will substantially weaken our commitment to ensuring ethical conduct .,Democratic
i think the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Democratic
hefley ) xz4001740 was right in his letter .,Democratic
i think he had the intellectual honesty and integrity on this floor when he spoke .,Democratic
he is going to vote for the rule because he believes that some offensive aspects of the proposal have been taken out .,Democratic
but i tell my friend that the most egregious  long-lasting  impacting change remains in this package .,Democratic
therefore  i urge my colleagues on behalf of the american people  on behalf of the integrity of this institution  on behalf of our commitment to ensure ethical conduct on behalf of the american people  that this not be passed .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i strongly oppose the radical new provision included in this rules package resolution which would violate the constitution by allowing the speaker and a small group of members to usurp the powers of a majority of the house and act with only a `` provisional quorum '' instead of the real thing .,Democratic
the proposal would deny the plain language of section 5 of article i of the constitution and create a new category of quorum -- a `` provisional quorum '' -- which the constitution expressly forbids .,Democratic
it destroys the very idea of the quorum .,Democratic
it would also demolish a 99-year-old precedent  based on the constitution  that a quorum of the house consists of a majority of the membership chosen  sworn  and living .,Democratic
for each house member deprived of the right to exert an impact on the work of the house  either through physical presence in or absence from the chamber  the approximately 600  000 persons represented by each member would be deprived of their rights to democratic representation in the legislative body structured to be closest to the american people .,Democratic
this proposal transfers the rights of those `` closest to the people '' to those closest to the house floor .,Democratic
the proposal takes the guise of a rules change which the house has no power to pass  since the constitution determines what kind of body the house is  and what it can -- and can not -- do .,Democratic
under this proposal  a majority of members of the house could be alive and well and fully cognizant  but unable to reach the floor  while the few who are present could usurp their authority and the powers of the house .,Democratic
article i  section 5 of the constitution states that a quorum consists of a majority  and  in the absence of a majority  all that the remaining minority of members of the house can do is either adjourn from day to day or vote to compel the attendance of absent members .,Democratic
there are no other options -- no matter how inconvenient that fact may be for any faction on the floor of the house during a time of emergency .,Democratic
the fact that the constitution authorizes a minority to compel the attendance of the absentees clearly indicates that the absentees are needed to conduct business .,Democratic
the constitution does not guarantee that a minority of the house will necessarily succeed in compelling the attendance of absent members to create a constitutional quorum .,Democratic
and such a result could indeed cause a crisis  which h. res.,Democratic
5 would do nothing to remedy .,Democratic
unfortunately  during the last congress the house refused to make serious progress toward ensuring continuity of government .,Democratic
let 's consider how the plan before us today actually might operate .,Democratic
suppose that  in the aftermath of a catastrophic emergency which caused mass casualties and disrupted transportation and communications nationwide  a presiding officer existed in the house who might either be the speaker or another member of the house acting as `` speaker pro tempore '' from a list of names left by a deceased speaker .,Democratic
suppose that the presiding officer decided  if a quorum of the majority of members failed to appear within a specified time period  that members who were n't present on the house floor or any other designated place of meeting ceased to be members for purposes of determining a quorum .,Democratic
suppose the rump minority of members who had managed to reach the floor wanted to pass major legislation  including a declaration of war or authorization for use of military force  send constitutional amendments to the states for ratification  expel members from their seats  or elect a new speaker to become acting president of the united states  all using a `` provisional quorum '' of one-half of the members present  plus one .,Democratic
could they do these things ?,Democratic
the proposed rule says they could .,Democratic
the constitution says they could not .,Democratic
the resolution gives the member presiding the effective power to temporarily define out of existence those members who do n't respond to a specified series of quorum calls .,Democratic
these members ' seats would not be considered vacant  but they would fall into a kind of extra-constitutional limbo until the missing members -- or a majority of the total membership -- reappeared in the house .,Democratic
it is even possible that some states might seek to replace members who do not answer the `` provisional quorum '' call in the house by ordering special elections even though the members might be known to be alive .,Democratic
all members are equal under the constitution  and the right to membership in this house is not determined by a speaker  speaker pro tempore  or a rump of a minority of the body .,Democratic
it is determined by a vote of the people  and only a constitutionally constituted house may exercise the power to determine the qualifications of its members and whether they have been duly elected .,Democratic
the supreme court has ruled that the house may not add qualifications for membership beyond those expressly stated in the constitution .,Democratic
if a member has been duly elected and taken the oath  he remains a member  and can only be removed through resignation  or through expulsion .,Democratic
there is no constitutional requirement that a member must appear on the floor to maintain membership  or that house membership can somehow lapse .,Democratic
it is surprising that some who only last year during debate on the `` continuity of representation act ''  h.r.,Democratic
2844  spoke eloquently about the status of a house consisting only of members elected by the people are now supporting a proposal to define those elected members out of existence .,Democratic
members who are trapped at an airport because the transportation system is inoperative  for example  do not simply cease to exist  nor can their powers be vested in other members  willingly or not .,Democratic
their absence has potential consequences  including the inability of the house to act until the collective body is `` assembled '' again  as the constitution requires .,Democratic
the resolution would also do an end run around the issue of `` disability ''  a matter not addressed in the constitution and one which requires a constitutional amendment to resolve  as the 25th amendment did in the case of the president .,Democratic
disabled members -- whom we might describe as those either physically injured or mentally incapable so as to be incapable of participating in the work of the house -- have the same status as those who are fully functional .,Democratic
the constitution makes no mention of disabled members  but it does not give the house the power to pretend they do n't exist .,Democratic
the house has never expelled or otherwise attempted to remove a sitting member on the grounds of disability .,Democratic
proponents of the proposal before us today claim to address the problem of incapacitated members  but only by effectively ignoring it .,Democratic
under the provisional quorum rule  these members would presumably not be able to appear on the floor and would be automatically excluded from the provisional quorum .,Democratic
it 's a very convenient solution to the disability problem  though blatantly unconstitutional .,Democratic
the house could adopt the provisional quorum plan as a house rule if the constitution were amended to authorize it to do so ; however  the constitution does not .,Democratic
the argument that the house is somehow exercising a constitutional power to make its own rules is also spurious .,Democratic
the house may only make rules which the constitution permits it to make .,Democratic
the house may not reinvent itself at will as a different kind of legislative body by pretending that it is simply changing its rules .,Democratic
at the very least  the house should debate the provisional quorum issue as a separate resolution  following hearings by the rules committee  with the speaker in the chair to signal the historic nature of the debate and the radical action proposed to be taken .,Democratic
burying the issue within this resolution with other controversial rule changes is an outrage .,Democratic
the 108th congress proved to be a huge disappointment because of its failure to effectively address many issues involving the stability of our structure of government  deficiencies brought to the forefront by the september 11 attacks  as well as a disturbing tendency to paper over controversies with legislation which fails to substantively address the problem .,Democratic
for example  the house rejected a constitutional amendment offered by representative baird of washington which would have reconstituted the house quickly through temporary appointments  pending special elections  if a large number of members were killed .,Democratic
i had introduced a different version of the proposal  h.j. res.,Democratic
89 .,Democratic
members opposed to the concept -- which is admittedly extremely controversial -- refused to allow real hearings and debate .,Democratic
even though prospects for passage of a constitutional amendment were extremely slim  a substantial debate would have served to educate the congress and the american people on the importance of these issues  and perhaps provide impetus in a search for alternatives .,Democratic
a major effort like this has to start somewhere .,Democratic
instead  the house passed  but the senate subsequently did not consider  h.r.,Democratic
2844  the `` continuity of representation act ''  which created an unrealistically fast  unfair  undemocratic and unworkable scheme to fill vacant house seats through a mandatory national 45-day special election period .,Democratic
this bill was referred principally to the house administration committee  where i was able to make an official record of its many flaws .,Democratic
neither house passed simple legislation which would have corrected an oversight in the legislation creating the department of homeland security in 2002  which failed to place the supposedly critical new cabinet officer somewhere -- anywhere -- in the statutory line of success to the presidency .,Democratic
though hearings were held  neither house addressed significant issues of presidential succession  such as the role of the speaker and president pro tempore and lame duck cabinet members in the succession lineup  and the ability of some officials to `` bump '' others serving as acting president under the current federal statute .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i plan to urge further action on congressional continuity issues in the new year  to work with my colleagues on the committee on house administration to assert our own jurisdiction more effectively and to push other relevant committees to do the same .,Democratic
we need both more effective action  and better internal cooperation  to accomplish these goals .,Democratic
the material previously referred to by ms.,Democratic
slaughter xz4003780 is as follows : explanation of 3-day layover supermajority vote requirement 1 .,Democratic
committee reports .,Democratic
clause 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) of rule xiii requires committee-reported bills to lay over for three days before consideration in the house .,Democratic
the purpose of this rule  which dates from the legislative reorganization act of 1970  is to give members who did not participate in committee deliberations time to consider the committee 's work .,Democratic
the three-day layover period gives members time to familiarize themselves with the legislation and to prepare for house debate  which could include drafting amendments to the committee-reported bill .,Democratic
when he was a minority rules committee member  chairman dreier explained the importance of this rule in the following way : `` why is it that we have the 3-day layover ?,Democratic
very simple  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i do not think you would enter into a business agreement or purchase a home or engage in any kind of major activity without having read it first .,Democratic
the idea behind the 3-day layover is very simple .,Democratic
it is there so that we may in fact allow members to have the opportunity to review legislation before they exercise their constitutional right and vote for it or against it.,Democratic
'' althoug chairman dreier was very critical of special rules that waived the 3-day layover when he was a minority rules committee member  his committee routinely reports special rules waiving 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation .,Democratic
in the 108th congress  the rules committee waived the 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation 31 times .,Democratic
the purpose of this amendment is to restore regular order to the committee reporting process .,Democratic
it would allow the house to adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation only with a two-thirds vote -- in the same way the house must approve a rule calling for same-day consideration of a bill by a two-thirds vote .,Democratic
2 .,Democratic
conference reports .,Democratic
house-senate conferences are a critical part of the congressional deliberative process because they produce the final legislative product that becomes the law of the land .,Democratic
the conference is where the final compromises are made and the final statutory language on the bill 's toughest issues is negotiated and drafted .,Democratic
as chairman dreier wrote back in 1993 : `` deliberative democracy is just as important at the end of the legislative process as it is at the formative subcommittee stages or the amendatory floor stage .,Democratic
in fact  the case can be made that it is even more important that congress be fully informed and deliberate on that final product since that is the version that will become law.,Democratic
'' because only a restricted group of house members participate in conferences and because conference reports can contain significant policy changes from the house-approved version of a bill  the standing house rules provide members a number of protections against the conference process .,Democratic
perhaps the most important protection is the one found in clause 8 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) of house rules xxii  which requires conference reports and joint explanatory statements to lay over for three days after publication in the congressional record .,Democratic
the purpose of this rule is very clear .,Democratic
since most members do not participate in the conference  they need time to study and familiarize themselves with the conference product .,Democratic
conference reports on major legislation run sometimes hundreds although conference reports are privileged and could come directly to the floor for consideration without a rule  they are routinely considered under special rules because they are often in technical violation of one or more sections of rule xxii or the budget act of 1974 .,Democratic
while it is understandable that the majority may need to use special rules to waive certain points of order against the content or consideration of conference reports in particular situations  the majority has made it the practice to grant `` blanket waivers '' to virtually every conference report the house considers .,Democratic
twenty-five of the 28 special one of the troubling consequences of this policy is that members only learn about the details of a conference report after it has already passed the house .,Democratic
some of these conference reports reconfirm the truth of the old saying that `` the devil is in the details.,Democratic
'' chairman dreier made this very same argument  when  as a minority rules committee member  he opposed waiving the 3-day layover on conference reports .,Democratic
he wrote : `` the house and senate have been repeatedly embarrassed over the years by conference reports on voluminous pieces of legislation which have been voted on before even properly printed or distributed  let alone understood .,Democratic
only after their enactment have some of the provisions come back to haunt the congress.,Democratic
'' the 108th congress has had its share of embarrassing episodes involving the quick approval of conference reports that were later discovered to contain controversial provisions added into bills during the conference stage .,Democratic
for example : one of the earliest actions of the 108th congress was to repeal the embarrassing provision republican leaders had slipped into the homeland security conference report at the end of the 107th congress that protected eli lilly and a number of other pharmaceutical companies from civil liability for their production of the vaccine preservative thimerosal .,Democratic
the energy bill conference added scores of obscure provisions that had not appeared in the house or senate bills  including the embarrassing `` greenbonds initiative  '' which turned out to be subsidy to build a hooters restaurant in shreveport  louisiana .,Democratic
the recent conference report for the fy05 omnibus funding bill included a provision giving appropriations committee members and staff access to the internal revenue service tax returns of u.s. citizens .,Democratic
to avoid future embarrassing episodes such as these and to restore members ' rights to have three days to study a conference report  this section would allow the house to adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of conference report only with a two-thirds vote .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i strongly oppose the changes in the house ethics rules that the republican majority is seeking to adopt today .,Democratic
the proposed republican rule changes would cripple the ethics process in the house and dramatically lower the bar for standards of official conduct .,Democratic
late yesterday  the republican majority in the house released the details of its rules package for the 109th congress .,Democratic
some of the newspapers reported this morning that the majority had abandoned its efforts to loosen rules governing members ' ethical conduct  but this is not the case .,Democratic
while the majority backed away from some of its rule changes  the most egregious ethics change remains .,Democratic
this provision would make it much more difficult for the committee on standards of official conduct to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of the house .,Democratic
under current rules  if the ethics committee deadlocks on whether or not to pursue an ethics complaint against a member of the house  the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee .,Democratic
under the proposed change  a complaint against a member would be tabled unless a majority votes to take action on it within 45 days .,Democratic
since the committee is evenly split with five republicans and five democrats  either political party could simply block an ethics complaint by stonewalling and running out the clock .,Democratic
there is no doubt that if the proposed rule change had been in effect during the last congress  no action would have been taken against the members of the house who were reprimanded as a result of the ethics committee 's investigation of bribery allegations raised in connection with the vote on the medicare prescription drug act of 2003 .,Democratic
the committee would have deadlocked and the entire matter swept under the rug 45 days after the complaint was made .,Democratic
i was listening to the debate on this earlier .,Democratic
the chairman of the ethics committee said that he does not favor this change .,Democratic
he said he would like it removed .,Democratic
why then is the majority leadership pursuing this change  when it is opposed by the ranking republican on the ethics committee ?,Democratic
at a time when public confidence in congress is so low and the nation faces so many challenges  it is inexplicable that the first order of business in the new session is to water down the ethics rules in the house and make it even more difficult to discipline lawmakers who abuse their office .,Democratic
this should not be a partisan matter .,Democratic
the proposed rule change harms the integrity and credibility of the house as an institution  and that reflects badly on all of us  republicans and democrats alike .,Democratic
i urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this assault on ethics enforcement in the house .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the proposed changes in the ethics rules .,Democratic
i served for 8 years on the committee on standards of official conduct  and it is not an enviable assignment .,Democratic
but members who have never served on the committee would be proud of how these tasks are approached .,Democratic
it is a committee that is evenly split .,Democratic
in the 8 years i served  we had unanimous votes .,Democratic
the members who serve think about the institution .,Democratic
they are there to serve the american people and the institution .,Democratic
it has not been a partisan body .,Democratic
it has been one that holds other members to a high ethical standard .,Democratic
these rules will undermine the committee on standards of official conduct  and the process of using the committee on rules rather than the committee on standards of official conduct to deliberate on the changes is also undercutting the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
i recommend that we do not support these rule changes .,Democratic
and i also want to mention on the homeland security provision of the rule  it is a huge mistake to `` murky up '' the jurisdiction over cybersecurity .,Democratic
we are at tremendous risk for a cyberattack  and the changes in that area will make us less safe .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the first day of a new congress should be a day for hope .,Democratic
it should be a day when all of us look forward with optimism to the work ahead .,Democratic
but today is not that kind of day .,Democratic
instead  the leadership of this house is beginning the new year in the worst possible way  by gutting the ethical standards of the united states house of representatives .,Democratic
talk about starting off on the wrong foot .,Democratic
in the rules package before us today  the republican leadership is sending a very clear message .,Democratic
they are admitting that they are so ethically challenged that they can not conform to the rules they previously adopted  so they must now relax those rules .,Democratic
what an awful example to the nation and to the rest of the world .,Democratic
we should be strengthening the ethical standards of this house  not weakening them .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the republican party regained a majority of seats in this body in 1994  in part by promising greater accountability and a more honest system in the nation 's capital .,Democratic
their actions have been anything but honest ; and now with this rules package  their rush to the bottom continues .,Democratic
today is just one more example of the ethical lapses we have seen in this house  a house where major legislation is now written by industry lobbyists  a house where members are not even given the courtesy of being able to read bills before they are voted on  and a house where bad behavior is not reprimanded  but rewarded .,Democratic
as members of congress  we should be held to the highest possible ethical standards .,Democratic
that means not breaking the law .,Democratic
that means not dancing around the law  and that means conducting ourselves in a manner that reflects credibility on the house at all times .,Democratic
facing the possible indictment of a member of their leadership  the republicans attempted in secret to change the rules to protect their ethically challenged colleagues .,Democratic
however  in the face of mounting public controversy  the public leadership caved last night and rescinded the change .,Democratic
they blinked and they buckled .,Democratic
but the speaker 's spokesman commented on this flip-flop saying that the issue had become a `` distraction.,Democratic
'' not wrong  mind you  but just distracting .,Democratic
i am getting whiplash just watching all this stuff .,Democratic
but  mr.,Democratic
speaker  let us be clear that the republican leadership did not find religion in this issue .,Democratic
if they believed that what they were about to do was truly wrong  they would not have proposed these rule changes in the first place .,Democratic
but while republicans try to pull a fast one claiming that the majority leader fell on his sword for the good of his party  the truth is that the rules package for the 109th congress still in a very meaningful way fundamentally weakens the ethics system here in the house of representatives .,Democratic
i strongly urge the american people and members of the press and my colleagues to closely examine these rule changes  especially those made to the ethics standards .,Democratic
under the old rules  a properly filed ethics complaint is automatically investigated if that complaint is not acted upon within 45 days .,Democratic
remember  as the gentlewoman from new york stated  that the ethics committee is evenly divided between democrats and republicans ; and to ensure that partisan politics did not prevail in the ethics process  a tie vote ensures a formal investigation .,Democratic
but under this proposed rules package  there must be a majority vote to investigate a properly filed ethics complaint ; and if that complaint is not acted upon with within 45 days  that ethics complaint dies .,Democratic
in other words  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the chairman of the committee  whoever that may be  could stonewall the process  refuse to call for a vote  and ultimately kill any ethics complaint without any action .,Democratic
but this also allows any member potentially under investigation to run the clock out by stonewalling investigators until the 45 days are up .,Democratic
the american people deserve better than this from their elected representatives .,Democratic
we serve at the pleasure of our constituents  and we have a responsibility to uphold the highest ethical standards .,Democratic
over the past decade  the republican leadership has careened down the pathway of irresponsibility  and now we are at a crossroads .,Democratic
there are those of us who truly believe members of congress should be held to a higher standard and who will make a stand and fight for real accountability from our colleagues  and there will be those who blindly follow their leadership  who vote to weaken the rules of this institution  first written by thomas jefferson  because they fear the retribution of their leaders .,Democratic
this should be a place where honesty and integrity are the standard  not a place where the rules are changed merely to protect a powerful few from their own ethical shortcomings .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we can stop this debacle .,Democratic
let us start over .,Democratic
let us make this right .,Democratic
let us make the house of representatives an example of high standards and ethical decency .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this rules package .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the rules package .,Democratic
every house member should vote to put the house on record against ethical and procedural abuses that contaminate this institution .,Democratic
the stench of special interest corruption is overwhelming congress  and repulsing the public .,Democratic
it is time the house rules reflected the ethical standards and common sense of the american people .,Democratic
i came to this house 30 years ago  and our historic incoming class brought with it one of the strongest tides of reform ever seen : rules were changed  chairmen were replaced  procedures were modernized so that the voice of the people was heard  and respected  in this house of the people .,Democratic
ten years ago  the republicans took control of the house  promising a new era of reform .,Democratic
to read the national newspapers  it is evident to everyone -- except themselves -- that the republicans have betrayed their promise of reform .,Democratic
they have tolerated misconduct and enshrined special interests as never before .,Democratic
today  we give them  and all members  an opportunity to restore public trust by voting for two commonsense amendments to the house rules .,Democratic
first  no sitting member should negotiate for a new job with any organization that has had business before his or her committee for a year .,Democratic
that 's not hard to understood : no one should be shaping public policy with an eye on a future private sector salary .,Democratic
second  no bill should be brought to the house floor unless members have had 3 days to read it first .,Democratic
that 's not hard to understand : we should not be passing bills that are hundreds of pages in length -- sometimes over 1  000 pages -- without ever having seen what is in the bill .,Democratic
ronald reagan thought it was a bad idea ; surely today 's house republicans can agree .,Democratic
let 's be honest about it : 99 percent of the american people outside the beltway will agree with both of these principles -- no negotiating for new jobs with special interests ; members should know what they are voting on before it becomes law .,Democratic
we should n't even have to have a debate .,Democratic
but we do .,Democratic
less than a month ago  the nation was stunned to learn that the committee chairman who had fashioned a blatantly pro-drug industry  anti-senior  anti-consumer prescription drug law was retiring and taking a job with the pharmaceutical industry .,Democratic
in fact  our former colleague assumes his job with phrma today  just as we are taking our oaths of office .,Democratic
mr. tauzin will reportedly be earning a salary nearly 13 times what he earned when he wrote that pro-industry bill -- one of the best paid lobbyists in washington .,Democratic
he earned it .,Democratic
that prescription drug law will enrich him  but it takes billions of dollars out of the pockets of america 's senior citizens -- by prohibiting them from purchasing cheaper drugs from canada  and by prohibiting the federal government from negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry -- his new employer -- for lower drug prices .,Democratic
that 's worth billions to the drug industry .,Democratic
while the deal was not announced until last month  the discussions began a year ago  as was widely reported at the time .,Democratic
in fact  a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january 24 on cnn.com as saying that republican congressman tauzin 's negotiation with pharma `` does n't look very good.,Democratic
'' it does n't look `` very good '' today either  as millions of seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill  and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image of the drug industry .,Democratic
we all know this stinks .,Democratic
and so do our constituents .,Democratic
let 's put an end to it today by barring negotiations for private jobs by members of congress .,Democratic
that 's what our constituents would want us to do .,Democratic
and at the same time  let 's put an end to the outrageous practice of voting on complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read them -- bills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharma 's whispers in his ears .,Democratic
is n't it bad enough that republicans majority writes the bills in secret  without input from the democrats who represent 48 percent of the country ?,Democratic
without scrutiny by the press ?,Democratic
without review by the public must we also vote on secret legislation  without reading it  without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck in without any review ?,Democratic
i urge all members to put party aside and vote the way your constituents would want you to vote : an end to private job negotiations while serving in public office  and full disclosure of the contents of legislation before we vote .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i also vigorously oppose the proposed rule change that would allow an ethics investigation to end after 45 days of the ethics committee of five democrats and five republicans remained deadlocked .,Democratic
today  the republicans are once again putting partisan politicians ahead of ethics by moving forward with their plan to shield their embattled majority leader -- tom delay -- from any further investigation .,Democratic
the goal of this change is to block the ethics committee from considering pending and future matters that could prove to be damaging to their party .,Democratic
under the present rules  if the chair and the ranking minority member of the ethics committee can not agree whether to investigate a complaint  the committee begins an initial investigation into the matter .,Democratic
but  under the republicans ' proposed rule change  the republican chairman of the ethics committee -- who is handpicked by the speaker -- could simply refuse to examine a complaint .,Democratic
after 45 days  the complaint would be dropped  without even an initial investigation into the matter .,Democratic
this new rule would allow republicans to block pending ethics matters and prevent future investigations from moving forward .,Democratic
and the reason is very simple : there are at least two matters currently pending against republican leaders  including majority leader tom delay .,Democratic
contrary to this morning 's press reports  the republicans have n't backed away from their attempts to shield delay from further investigation  they 've simply become a little more deceptive in how they 're doing it .,Democratic
last year  when the ethics committee admonished delay three times  it deferred action on another serious charge -- his role in funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pac -- until after the investigation against him had been completed .,Democratic
the rule change now proposed by his republican colleagues would allow the republican chairman of the committee to block any further investigation of delay 's activities  shielding the minority leader from further admonishments even if he is indicted by a grand jury .,Democratic
also pending is an investigation of republican lobbyist  jack abramoff  and former delay staffer  michael scanlon  and their ties to several republican members .,Democratic
changing the ethics rules would permit the republicans to halt any investigation of the abramoff scandal and the members who could be implicated in their outrageous looting of native americans .,Democratic
i urge a `` no '' vote on this unbalanced and improper rules package .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Democratic
hoyer ) xz4001890  the distinguished minority whip .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time .,Democratic
the gentlewoman is correct : i currently serve on the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
and despite what i read in the morning papers  the republican leadership is eliminating a major traditional ethics standard of the house .,Democratic
while we are relieved that the republican leadership did not go as far as they wanted to  i do not think we can be happy with the trend that is clearly downwards as it is today .,Democratic
the new rule means no ethics violations will be investigated of party leaders  whether they be republican or democratic  control their members  since a tie vote means a dismissal .,Democratic
the logical result is more partisan political pressure on the committee members .,Democratic
america was intended to be a city on a hill with the highest standards for the government in the world ; and sadly  today we are lowering those standards .,Democratic
the majority is proud of their political power and their skills at political games  and politics is an important part of our business ; but principles must be held above politics because no man can serve two masters  both principles and politics .,Democratic
when we are guided by only political consideration in the house leadership today  the house abandons its principles and the moral compass .,Democratic
i do not enjoy serving on the committee .,Democratic
i do know something about legislative ethics  having first been elected to the state house of representatives after a tremendous sharpstown bank scandal in texas 1972 .,Democratic
born and raised in texas  i understand what it means about conservative government  but i can not begin to explain how eliminating a traditional ethics standard is conservative in the slightest .,Democratic
the house leadership can fool some of the people some of the time  like they did today when the papers said they were dropping ethics changes  when they clearly continue to weaken the standards .,Democratic
however  the people recognize this for what it is  a weakening of our government 's ethics in pursuit of political parity by one party  be it democrat or republican .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the point of order .,Democratic
the constitution defines a quorum to conduct business as the majority of each house .,Democratic
the question of course before us in this debate is  a majority of what ?,Democratic
what is the denominator in that equation ?,Democratic
the precedent holds that the total number of the membership of the house is those members who are chosen  sworn and living and whose membership has not been terminated by action of the house .,Democratic
removal by action of the house is also a defined term  expulsion by a vote of two-thirds in article 1  section 5. the constitution also gives the house the authority to compel attendance when members do not answer the call of the chair in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide .,Democratic
and  in fact  the sergeant at arms has been sent to gather members by force on prior occasions .,Democratic
this amendment before us to the rules gives the speaker nearly unfettered authority to change the number of the members of the whole house to exclude members who are chosen  sworn  and living but who do not answer the call of the chair .,Democratic
this would seem to amount to a constructive expulsion without a two-thirds vote of the whole house .,Democratic
for example  suppose the house is at its full complement of 435 members .,Democratic
a quorum would then be 218 .,Democratic
now  suppose only 400 members answer the speaker 's call for whatever reason .,Democratic
they are still living .,Democratic
they are still chosen .,Democratic
they are still sworn .,Democratic
they have not been expelled .,Democratic
now a quorum by order of the speaker would be 200 .,Democratic
the house may conduct its business with only 200 members present .,Democratic
if this is triggered in a time of national emergency  the consequences could be dire .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we heard the distinguished chair  or maybe he is only the presumptive chair  of the committee on rules  at this point ; but in any event  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
dreier ) xz4001150 said a moment ago that this proposed rules change is constitutional because the constitution could not have contemplated that the house could not function .,Democratic
but the constitution did not contemplate that the majority of the members of the house might in fact be the victims of an act of mass terrorism .,Democratic
those things were not contemplated at the time .,Democratic
the fact is we do need to amend the constitution to take care of this very serious question ; but this provision for the reasons stated by the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
baird ) xz4000110  for the reasons that i stated a moment ago  is clearly unconstitutional .,Democratic
certainly  before we take such a measure  it deserves much more extensive debate and hearings and discussion than it can have by three or four speakers in this context now .,Democratic
so i urge that members take careful consideration to the question of constitutionality here .,Democratic
this may provoke court action  and we should not adopt this now in the context of an overall rules change with this very serious amendment to the constitution  which is what it amounts to ; it can not receive adequate consideration in terms of its constitutionality either in terms of its merit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to what i consider a shameless rules package which will undermine the ethical standards held by this house .,Democratic
after the elections in november  the first thing the republican majority did was to lower the house 's ethical standard .,Democratic
in an act of unprecedented shamelessness  they changed the rule of their party to permit an indicted member of their party to remain in a leadership position .,Democratic
yesterday  in the face of an overwhelming bipartisan and public condemnation they changed their rules back .,Democratic
this is not shocking .,Democratic
what is shocking is that they ever considered it in the first place .,Democratic
even more shocking  just if you think you have seen it all  is that the majority considered deleting the most fundamental of ethics rules which says that members of the house should be held to the highest standards of ethical conduct .,Democratic
it says a member shall conduct himself at all times in a manner that should reflect creditably on the house of representatives .,Democratic
dropping this rule is unthinkable .,Democratic
yet republicans only decided to keep it last night when the issue became too hot for them to handle .,Democratic
thank heavens it became too hot for them to handle  but what is completely apparent to the public and those who follow the congress is that the republicans did not leave it at that .,Democratic
they went on to make new mistakes  to undermine the ethical standard of the house .,Democratic
instead of a bipartisan effort to strengthen the ethical process  the republicans have engaged in a completely partisan exercise that should be an affront to every member on either side of the aisle who has served in this body .,Democratic
the proposed changes which are still in this rules package are destructive  and they are unethical .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i know of what i speak .,Democratic
i served on the committee on standards of official conduct for 6 years  and then for a seventh year i served as a part of the bipartisan committee to rewrite the ethics rules .,Democratic
it is bipartisan  evenly divided  and we came up with new ethics rules  some of which survived the floor that year in 1997 .,Democratic
the package that was put together was meant to be fair to members as well as uphold the high ethical standards .,Democratic
it says that members should be judged by their actions and by the rules of the house and the law .,Democratic
so it was only about what took place  the facts and the law .,Democratic
it was not about rumor .,Democratic
it was not about hearsay .,Democratic
it was about the facts  the rules of the house and the law .,Democratic
there was a process which was fair to members because  as i say  as someone who has 7 years on the ethical process  that it is very hard to make judgments about our peers .,Democratic
it is a very  very difficult task  and we want to be fair  but we have a higher responsibility to uphold that ethical standard .,Democratic
so it was put forth and has been the rules of the house and the committee on standards of official conduct that in order to cease or dismiss a case  we had to have a majority of the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
that would be eliminated today .,Democratic
that would be eliminated today .,Democratic
so  on a partisan basis  there could be no cases that go forward .,Democratic
either party with half the votes in the committee  evenly split  could cease and desist any complaints from going forward .,Democratic
that is simply not right .,Democratic
the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is to have a process in which to deal with ethics complaints against members .,Democratic
the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is not to whitewash or to have a system that says nothing will ever move forward .,Democratic
what could the republicans be afraid of that they would so fundamentally undermine the ethical process of the house to say we are going to establish a system where nothing will ever go forward ?,Democratic
this simply is wrong .,Democratic
we owe it to the public  we owe it to each other to uphold that ethical standard .,Democratic
so  as i say  on the first day of this new congress  the republican majority is publicly demonstrating what has been evident for some time  and that is its arrogance  its pettiness  its shortsighted focus on their political life rather than to decide how we are each of us fit to govern .,Democratic
here is the thing .,Democratic
we have this rules package before us .,Democratic
they did some flash last night so that the press is saying  oh  they blinked .,Democratic
they did blink on a couple of different scores  but the fundamental challenge to the ethical standard of the house being enforced is still in this rules package  and it should be rejected .,Democratic
democrats have made two proposals .,Democratic
one of them is to remove this change  and that would be a vote on the previous question  and then on the motion to recommit we address two other abuses of power that should be addressed in this bill .,Democratic
one is what i will call the tauzin rule  and the democratic motion to commit would forbid a member of congress to negotiate with an outside entity that has business before his or her committee and before the congress  in the current congress or in a previous congress  called the tauzin rule because mr.,Democratic
tauzin  who managed the medicare bill  was at the time being courted by the pharmaceutical industry which was to benefit from provisions in the prescription drug bill  a rumored $ 2 million a year salary for selling america 's seniors down the river .,Democratic
that is simply wrong .,Democratic
has this become an auction house ?,Democratic
the public has to think and believe that when we are here and we are on the public payroll and we are members of congress that our accountability is to them and not to our next job .,Democratic
i call that the revolving door  shorthand for the tauzin rule  and the impact of that is a very  very bad prescription drug bill that put pharmaceutical companies first  seniors last .,Democratic
in our motion to commit we also address the 3-day rule .,Democratic
as many of my colleagues recall in recent memory  there was occasion on the floor when a huge bill of many thousands of pages  containing nine appropriations bills  seven of which never appeared on the floor of the united states senate  came before this house where the matter was overnight passed in the committee on rules  came to the floor the next morning without any chance of members being able to read the bill .,Democratic
it came under the martial law rule the republicans use by which they say we waive the 3-day rule by a simple majority .,Democratic
it should take two-thirds  but by a simple majority we waive the 3-day rule .,Democratic
well  why was it important ?,Democratic
it was important that day because there was a great deal in that bill that members did not know about that they were voting on and should not they know that  but very specifically in that bill and it was not found out until the because of the egregiousness of that and the violation of privacy of the american people  i insisted that the members come back to vote on that rather than just have it be done by unanimous consent to remove that provision from the law .,Democratic
why did i call members back ?,Democratic
so that the american people will know because of the abuse of power in this house  ignoring of the 3-day rule  that members can not even see what they are voting on before they vote on it  and something like looking at your tax returns could be sneaked into the bill  without any safeguards to protect people from that .,Democratic
that is just one example .,Democratic
another example is the medicare prescription drug bill which came to the floor without proper time for review as well .,Democratic
the list goes on and on .,Democratic
in our motion to commit  we address the abuse of power of a powerful chairman  negotiating for a job while he was a member of congress  who had control of the bill over the industry  which was offering him $ 2 million a year .,Democratic
that is how much it cost to sell the american seniors down the river  and i hope that even if you separate yourself from any of the examples and just say i sent you to congress to represent me  you do that in what you say there and how you vote  and i expect that you know what you are voting on .,Democratic
the message to the american people here this afternoon is a vote for the motion to commit  is a vote for members to be able to read a bill before they vote on it .,Democratic
is that asking too much ?,Democratic
the republicans say it is .,Democratic
so a yes vote on the motion to commit gives members the 3 days which under the rules of the house they are entitled to .,Democratic
a vote for the motion to commit stops the unethical process of members negotiating with people outside  whose bills they are managing inside this congress  in this congress or in the previous congress .,Democratic
the previous question vote would say no to the republicans in their evisceration of the ethical process of this house by saying that you do not need a majority to dismiss a case ; you can just do it if all the members of your party on the committee decide to stick with you on it .,Democratic
it is simply not right  and this should not be partisan .,Democratic
that is really what is really sad about it .,Democratic
everything that we have done in the ethics process has had some level of respect to the extent that it has because it has been bipartisan  bipartisan in writing the rules  evenly divided committee  cooperation between the chair and ranking member .,Democratic
today is a major departure from that  and i guess maybe i have just spent too many long hours for too many long years in the committee on standards of official conduct room trying to respect the rights of members and our higher responsibility to uphold an ethical standard .,Democratic
to see the republicans today run roughshod  rigging the rules  negotiating for jobs  no reading of the bill  it is an outrage .,Democratic
it is an absolute outrage .,Democratic
so i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the previous question  yes on the motion to commit  and by all means  however you vote on those  no on this very shameful rules package .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
mcgovern ) xz4002630 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the distinguished gentlewoman because ethics equals integrity .,Democratic
i will submit my statement into the record .,Democratic
vote a resounding no on the resolution that is on the floor  and i hope that we will come before our peers and recognize that ethics equals integrity .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the proposed changes to the house rules under the privileged resolution before the committee of the whole house .,Democratic
taken together  this package of proposals will gut the house rules .,Democratic
our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to completely gut and render ineffective the current rule xi  which provides that a properly filed ethics complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member of the ethics committee gets referred to an investigative committee .,Democratic
the republican proposal would provide that  unless the committee votes by majority to take action on a properly filed complaint  no action will be taken after 45 days .,Democratic
this change to rule xi would take away an important oversight power and allow partisan politics to kill legitimate and colorable ethics complaints .,Democratic
a change like this would be an embarrassment to what this nation calls a `` democracy.,Democratic
'' furthermore  by allowing members to intentionally deadlock the vote of the ethics committee to kill a claim  we would be acting in contravention of the spirit of the u.s. constitution that guarantees procedural due process .,Democratic
we should strengthen the house ethnics rules rather than eviscerate them for the american people whom we represent .,Democratic
rules so relaxed that members can negotiate with a corporation  lobbying firm  or trade association that has business before their committee should not be further stripped .,Democratic
the honor that was bestowed upon this house upon its establishment must be maintained .,Democratic
members must be held accountable for their action .,Democratic
moreover  members should be given adequate time in which to read legislation that will be voted upon .,Democratic
since the legislation that we pass in this august body affects the entire nation -- which includes the districts represented by minority members  it is an injustice that insufficient time has been given for review of legislation .,Democratic
in the proposal that has been brought before the house does not contain the changes that are needed .,Democratic
it would be irresponsible for this body to accept what is before us .,Democratic
the proposed rule x amendment to create a standing committee on homeland security  on the other hand  is a smart one .,Democratic
it is only appropriate that this committee be made permanent and be given jurisdiction over `` overall homeland security policy.,Democratic
'' important organizational and admnistrative aspects of the department of homeland security  dhs  require oversight to ensure effective and efficient operation .,Democratic
dhs is a conglomeration of 22 federal agencies with more than 180  000 employees and a budget of $ 36 billion .,Democratic
because the department is still in its infancy stages  it is critical that committee oversight be applied to track and quickly eradicate deficiencies .,Democratic
the congress has just passed the national intelligence reform act  or s. 2845  that will change the way our intelligence is collected and processed .,Democratic
dhs will be an important partner to our intelligence agencies in order to keep america safe .,Democratic
in addition  with the challenges that we have had with adequately funding first responders  it is very important that congress retain a close relationship to the department .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i oppose the rules package that is before this body  and i urge my colleagues to defeat it .,Democratic
i yield the balance of my time .,Democratic
further  a rules change that changes the quorum for this body without a constitutional change is minimally undermining our constitutional values .,Democratic
vote `` no '' on this resolution and `` yea '' on the motion to recommitt .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from west virginia ( mr.,Democratic
mollohan ) xz4002810  the ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Democratic
cardin ) xz4000640 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
george miller ) xz4002780 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45-day period because  as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated  what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question .,Democratic
that  i suggest and submit  is something that this institution will suffer from .,Democratic
there has been much discussion recently regarding this package .,Democratic
it was anticipated that there would be additional provisions that were not submitted today  but let us be clear what is at risk here .,Democratic
it is the confidence of the american people in the integrity of this institution .,Democratic
perception  as we all know  is reality .,Democratic
and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee on standards of official conduct in which either side has a veto  it will undermine the confidence of the people in our ethical process .,Democratic
my question to the proponents would be  what is wrong with the current rules ?,Democratic
we have operated on them .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i would like to address the ethics-related provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the committee on rules .,Democratic
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct in the last congress .,Democratic
it was an honor to serve with the gentleman from colorado ( chairman hefley )  as he always managed to chair the committee in a completely bipartisan manner .,Democratic
the headlines in this morning 's paper say `` gop abandons ethics changes.,Democratic
'' it turns out that the headline is at best only half right .,Democratic
it is true that the most outrageous ethics undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package  but other provisions  provisions that would make major changes in the way the committee on standards of official conduct handles enforcements of the rules  they remain .,Democratic
there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house  both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures  but  and equally important  because of the partisan way in which they are being adopted .,Democratic
if there is to be a meaningful  viable ethics process in the house  it must be a genuinely bipartisan process .,Democratic
that point should be self-evident .,Democratic
how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis ?,Democratic
and to have a bipartisan process  it is absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis .,Democratic
what is more  because of the importance and the sensitive nature of the ethics rules  it is also essential that any proposed changes be considered in a thoughtful  considered  and open way  with all members being given the opportunity for input  democrats and republicans .,Democratic
until today  the house recognized these fundamental points .,Democratic
until today  the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the committee on standards of official conduct procedures in a slapdash way  with literally only hours of consideration  and on a party line vote .,Democratic
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the committee on rules that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules .,Democratic
for example  under the benign sounding heading  `` restore presumption of innocence  '' the committee on rules memorandum states  `` currently  if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days  the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee.,Democratic
'' fine .,Democratic
but that statement is incomplete and  therefore  misleading .,Democratic
the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration  either one of them may place the complaint on the committee 's agenda and when either one of them does that  an investigative committee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee .,Democratic
another example  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
under the heading `` due process for members  '' the committee on rules memorandum states that  `` under the current rule  the chairman and ranking member or the committee may take action against a member without a complaint  notice  or the opportunity to be heard.,Democratic
'' this statement clearly implies that the committee may determine that a member has committed a violation or impose a sanction without the member having such rights  and that suggestion  mr.,Democratic
speaker  is flatly wrong .,Democratic
the rules are replete with the rights for members who are accused of any violation .,Democratic
when you turn to the actual text of the `` due process '' amendments  you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations  but instead on committee letters or statements that `` reference the official conduct of a member.,Democratic
'' it may be well that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly  but what should those rights be ?,Democratic
they should be determined through a deliberative  fair  bipartisan process .,Democratic
but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
but in the circumstances that the rule addresses  that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter .,Democratic
no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance .,Democratic
so the effect of this amendment would be that whenever any alleged misconduct is brought to the committee 's attention  the committee may be forced to choose between either launching a formal investigation of the matter or dismissing it entirely .,Democratic
both of these rule changes lack careful consideration and  more seriously  are brought to us today through a partisan process .,Democratic
i 'd like to address the ethics-related provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the rules committee .,Democratic
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the ethics committee in the last congress  and i also served on the committee for 6 years during another time of controversy in the late 1980s .,Democratic
it was an honor to serve during the last 2 years with chairman hefley  as he always managed the committee in a completely bipartisan manner .,Democratic
a headline in this morning 's newspaper says  `` gop abandons ethics changes.,Democratic
'' it turns out that the headline is at best only half right .,Democratic
it 's true that the most outrageous ethics-undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package  but other provisions -- provisions that would make major changes in the way the ethics committee handles enforcement of the rules -- remain .,Democratic
there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house  both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures  and  equally important  because of the partisan way in which they would be adopted .,Democratic
if there is to be a meaningful  viable ethics process in the house  it must be a genuinely bipartisan process .,Democratic
that point should be self-evident -- how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis ?,Democratic
and to have a bipartisan process  it 's absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis .,Democratic
what 's more  because of the importance  and the sensitive nature of the ethics rules  it 's also essential that any proposed changes be considered in a thoughtful  considered  and open way  with all members being given the opportunity for input -- democrats and republicans .,Democratic
until today  the house recognized these fundamental points .,Democratic
until today  the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the ethics committee procedures in a slapdash way  with literally only hours of consideration  and on a party-line vote .,Democratic
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the rules committee that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules .,Democratic
for example  under the benign-sounding heading  `` restore presumption of innocence  '' the rules committee memorandum states  and i quote : `` currently  if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days  the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee.,Democratic
'' that statement is incomplete -- and therefore misleading .,Democratic
the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration  either one of them may place the complaint on the committee 's agenda  and when either one of them does that  an investigative subcommittee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee .,Democratic
another example : under the heading  `` due process for members  '' the rules committee memorandum states that  and i quote : `` under the current rule  the chairman and ranking member  or the committee  may take action against a member without a complaint  notice  or the opportunity to be heard.,Democratic
'' this statement clearly implies that the committee may determine that a member has committed a violation or impose a sanction without the member having such rights  and that suggestion is flatly wrong .,Democratic
the rules are replete with rights for members who are accused of any violation  and because of the bipartisan makeup of the committee  members are typically accorded rights well beyond those required by the rules .,Democratic
when you turn to the actual text of the `` due process '' amendments  you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations  but instead committee letters or statements that `` reference the official conduct of a member.,Democratic
'' it may well be that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly  but what should those rights be ?,Democratic
they should be determined through a deliberative  fair  bipartisan process .,Democratic
but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the ethics committee .,Democratic
but in the circumstances that the rule addresses  that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter .,Democratic
no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance .,Democratic
so the effect of this amendment would be that whenever any alleged misconduct is brought to the committee 's attention  the committee may be forced to choose between either launching a formal investigation of the matter  or dismissing it entirely .,Democratic
there would be no chance for an expedited but the proposed amendment that raises even more concern is the one that provides for automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within a period as short as 45 days .,Democratic
when the house last considered ethics committee procedures  in 1997  it rejected  on a bipartisan vote  an amendment that would have required the automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within 180 days .,Democratic
the reason that amendment was rejected is that it was recognized that such a time limit would encourage deadlock on the committee  and partisanship among the committee members .,Democratic
under a time limit  if one side or the other is uncomfortable about dealing with a particular complaint  those members do n't have to discuss it or otherwise try to deal with it -- by their just doing nothing  the complaint will disappear .,Democratic
yet now this provision for automatic dismissal has reappeared  and this time it has a far shorter time frame for committee consideration than the nearly identical provision that the house soundly rejected in 1997 .,Democratic
i want to close by asking all members  including all members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle  to give some serious consideration -- not just today  but in the weeks and months ahead -- to whether you genuinely want to have a meaningful ethics process in the house  and what we as members  individually and collectively  have to do in order for such a process to exist .,Democratic
as i said at the outset  for this process to exist  it has to be a truly bipartisan one  and it has to be treated with seriousness and respect .,Democratic
it has to be recognized that the basic purpose of the process is to consider and address legitimate ethics concerns  and if members are successful in using the process for partisan  political purposes  it is going to fail .,Democratic
the approval of these amendments would seriously undermine the process and  for that reason alone  this rules package should be defeated .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
gene green )  a member of the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
pelosi ) xz4003140  the minority leader .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
lofgren ) xz4002450 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to h. res.,Democratic
5  to the republican rules package .,Democratic
specifically  i oppose the proposed changes to rule x  which among other things creates a permanent standing committee on homeland security and grants legislative jurisdiction to that committee .,Democratic
i am not opposed to the creation of a permanent homeland security committee .,Democratic
indeed  i believe that the homeland security committee should be made permanent and should be granted jurisdiction over the overall homeland security policy of the federal government .,Democratic
further  i believe that a homeland security committee is needed to oversee the internal administration of such a large federal agency as the department of homeland security  dhs  which has over 180  000 employees .,Democratic
although h. res.,Democratic
5 includes these provisions  i oppose its grant of legislative jurisdiction to the new committee of areas that have previously been the jurisdiction of other committees .,Democratic
i oppose this grant of jurisdiction  not because of some desire to protect existing committees ' `` turf ''  but because transfer of these security issues to a new committee divests from the responsibility for those issues from those members who have substantial experience and expertise -- in some cases developed through decades of work -- on them .,Democratic
the existing committees are best equipped to give the full house the benefit of carefully thought out recommendations that provide effective security without unnecessary risks to safety or economic efficiency .,Democratic
it will take years for a new committee to be able to develop the expertise to provide the house and the nation with reports and recommendations of the quality that existing committees provide .,Democratic
it is not enough to say that members with particular areas of expertise will have an opportunity to be heard on these issues .,Democratic
the most effective way to influence policy is to be part of the debate and discussion in the early stages of policy formation ; simply voting yes or no when legislation makes it to the house floor is generally not sufficient participation to craft policy .,Democratic
i take this position on the basis of my 30 years of experience in the house  during which time i have given high priority to security  particularly the security of our transportation system .,Democratic
h. res.,Democratic
5 would divest responsibility for dhs ' transportation and port security functions from the transportation and infrastructure committee  t & amp ; i committee  and transfer it to the homeland security committee .,Democratic
however  transportation and port security can not be considered in a vacuum .,Democratic
developing sound security legislation requires balancing security risks against the economic and safety impacts of such measures on transportation industries and their customers .,Democratic
for example  we would not want to install technology on aircraft to protect against missile attacks if that technology would create disproportionate safety risks .,Democratic
in addition  security mandates are only one type of requirement imposed on transportation industries .,Democratic
other requirements include safety  consumer protection  environmental  accessibility  and competitiveness statutory or regulatory mandates .,Democratic
any security legislation or regulation must be considered in the context of the costs and benefits of all such requirements governing transportation industries .,Democratic
the committee on transportation and infrastructure has the responsibility and the expertise to broadly consider security risks  weigh all costs and benefits of proposed requirements  and determine the likely effects of such actions on transportation industries  their customers  and the existing framework of other statutory and regulatory requirements .,Democratic
the t & amp ; i committee  time and again  has proven it 's capable to ensure that the u.s. transportation system is efficient and safe  as well as secure .,Democratic
in the aftermath of the pan am flight 103 tragedy  the t & amp ; i committee developed the landmark aviation security improvement act of 1990 ( p.l .,Democratic
101-604 )  which mandated background checks for airline and airport employees and the deployment of bomb detection equipment for baggage at our nation 's airports .,Democratic
during the 1990s  our committee continued to respond to the changing security needs through oversight and legislation .,Democratic
in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks  the t & amp ; i committee developed and considered the aviation and transportation security act of 2001  atsa .,Democratic
atsa established a new transportation security administration  tsa  federalized the screening workforce  and required the screening of all checked baggage to protect against terrorist threats .,Democratic
the aviation subcommittee alone has held 19 hearings on aviation security issues since september 11 .,Democratic
since september 11  the t & amp ; i committee has also spearheaded important maritime and port security legislation including the maritime transportation security act of 2002  and the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2004 .,Democratic
the t & amp ; i committee has the member expertise  the staff  and the institutional memory to deal with these issues .,Democratic
i believe that the quality of congressional oversight and legislation on these issues will suffer if these issues are simply transferred wholesale to a new committee .,Democratic
it will take years for the new committee to develop the institutional background and expertise that currently resides in our committee .,Democratic
finally  the republican conference drafted these changes to rule x in isolation .,Democratic
democrats were afforded no role in crafting this critical security policy .,Democratic
i believe the proposed changes to rule x do not further the security of this nation .,Democratic
instead  i fear that they will hamper security by divesting from those members with the experience and institutional knowledge of these issues the direct responsibility to craft security policy .,Democratic
for all of these reasons  i oppose h. res.,Democratic
5 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Democratic
i urge every member of this house to vote no on the previous question .,Democratic
if the previous question is defeated  i will offer an amendment to strike from the proposed rules package a provision that effectively guts our already ailing ethics process .,Democratic
this provision would halt the investigation of properly filed ethics complaints if  after 45 days  the chair and ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct have not set up an investigation committee .,Democratic
i urge the members on both sides of the aisle to vote no on this previous question so we can delete this offensive provision .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question .,Democratic
mr. speaker  after the vote on the previous question  i will call for a yes vote on the motion to commit .,Democratic
my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members of congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest in the legislation referred to any committee on which that member serves .,Democratic
it also includes a rules change that would require a two-thirds vote in the house to waive the requirement in our standing rules that members must have 3 days to read the committee reports .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent to insert a statement as part of that immediately prior to the vote on the motion to commit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i offer a motion .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  all over washington and in the country  people are talking today about the majority 's last-minute decision to abandon rules changes that would have eviscerated longstanding ethical guidelines in this house  and  with that  the integrity of the institution .,Democratic
and while in the end the majority was right to withdraw these provisions  they hardly deserve our congratulations .,Democratic
the republicans simply succumbed to tough criticism from every major ethics group in washington  several major news organizations and house democrats .,Democratic
the rules changes in question were so egregious that rank-and-file republicans would not support their leadership 's plan .,Democratic
the proposals were so offensive that the ethics committee chairman broke with his own leadership on the issue .,Democratic
one of the changes would have permitted members  indicted by a grand jury on felony counts  to continue to hold house leadership positions .,Democratic
the measure was similar to a conference rule the house republican conference passed last fall to protect its leadership in the event that one of them is indicted .,Democratic
the fact that they ever considered changing the rules of the house in this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary on the ethical compass of this body 's leadership .,Democratic
they also planned to eliminate a 30-year standing rule that members of congress could be disciplined for actions that brought dishonor and discredit on this house  the people 's house .,Democratic
this standard is similar to the one that exists for the men and women serving in our military .,Democratic
how could they even think about changing the house rules in this regard when to do so would mean demanding a higher ethical standard from an 18-year-old private in the army than we who sit in this hallowed chamber ?,Democratic
how could we ask more from our young people than we ask of ourselves ?,Democratic
it is hard to believe that there was a time in the not too distant past when the republicans touted their high ethical and moral standards .,Democratic
mr. speaker  it seems to me that this entire episode has been a violation of the public trust .,Democratic
when americans enter their voting booths and cast their ballots for congress  they give us a very precious gift  their trust .,Democratic
american voters expect  and rightly so  that we as members of congress will conduct ourselves at the highest ethical standard and uphold democratic principles such as integrity and accountability .,Democratic
how can we as the guardians of democracy spread the values of self-governance across the world if we refuse to govern ourselves right here in this chamber ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  though we should all be relieved that the republicans were shamed into abandoning the most overtly egregious provisions  the remaining ethics provisions in today 's legislation will still destroy the house ethics process .,Democratic
i can not say it more plainly than that .,Democratic
the ethics process will be destroyed .,Democratic
the tactics have changed  but the end result is the same .,Democratic
the house ethics system will be gutted .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the committee on standards of official conduct is the only evenly divided committee in the house .,Democratic
as the rule stands today  if the five republicans and five democrats on the committee do not reach agreement about the merits of an ethics complaint  it is automatically referred to investigators .,Democratic
this approach was designed to take the partisan politics out of the equation and to ensure that meritorious complaints would be investigated regardless of the political winds of the day .,Democratic
under the republican rules package  one-half of the committee will now have the power to bury complaints  even the most meritorious ones .,Democratic
under the rules package before us today  if the committee is deadlocked  the ethics complaint dies .,Democratic
this one provision gives the republicans an enormous amount of control over who is and who is not investigated by the committee on standards of official conduct .,Democratic
in practical terms  the republicans have granted themselves veto power over any complaint it does not deem palatable .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this rules package would effectively eliminate the 45-day deadline the committee on standards of official conduct currently has to act on complaints .,Democratic
the 45-day requirement was designed to prevent ethics complaints from being buried away from public view and to ensure that those members who should be held accountable for corruption would be .,Democratic
this provision ensures that no ethics complaint will move forward against a republican without their leadership 's consent .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we can be sure that if these rules changes had been in place in the last congress  no ethics complaints would have seen the light of day .,Democratic
under the republicans  the ethical climate in washington has eroded enormously .,Democratic
when i speak to constituents  i find myself telling them to forget what they learned in school about how a bill becomes a law .,Democratic
in times past  our laws were written to serve the public interest .,Democratic
but today the sad reality is that corporations like enron write our nation 's policies .,Democratic
the medicare drug bill that was rammed through congress in the dead of night stands as a potent example of the ethical erosion of the house of representatives .,Democratic
when the dust settled on the prescription drug vote  former representative billy tauzin  the key author and then chairman of the committee on energy and commerce  had himself the republican rules package will reduce this committee to a paper tiger .,Democratic
the american people deserve much better than to have a `` for sale '' sign placed on the united states house of representatives .,Democratic
they deserve to be able to trust their elected leaders and have faith in the integrity of this institution .,Democratic
they should be able to expect accountability from their government .,Democratic
unfortunately  the lesson we have here today is if you have the power and you break the rules  you can just change the rules .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i know there are members on the other side of the aisle  because i know them  who care greatly about the integrity of this chamber  and i know that there are freshmen members here today eager to cast their first vote on behalf of the constituents whose trust they hold and the constitution they love .,Democratic
i challenge those new members  and any other republican who values integrity and the sanctity of the democratic process  to stand up for the values of those who trusted you to represent them .,Democratic
mr. speaker  at the close of this debate  i will be asking members to vote `` no '' on the previous question so i can strike from the rules package language that would allow the republicans to run out the clock on serious ethics complaints .,Democratic
immediately following that vote  i will ask for a `` yes '' on a motion to commit the resolution so that we can add two important rules changes .,Democratic
the first would prohibit members from negotiating lucrative job deals that capitalize on their committee membership .,Democratic
the other would guarantee that members have at least 3 days to read a house report before voting on it .,Democratic
when bills are rushed to the floor  cobbled together at the last minute  warm from the machine  pages are missing or  worse  outrageous provisions are slipped in by committee staff .,Democratic
lest we forget  the provision that opened up private taxpayers ' records that was sneaked into last year 's omnibus spending bill was by just such a staff member .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to vote to strike the egregious ethics changes in this package .,Democratic
we owe it to the constituents we serve  to this institution  and to the constitution that we adore and revere to restore the ethics and integrity to the people 's house .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. speaker  during rollcall vote no .,Democratic
3 on consideration of h. res.,Democratic
5  i was unavoidably detained .,Democratic
had i been present  i would have voted `` nay .,Democratic
'',Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge a no vote on the previous question .,Democratic
i call on all members of this house  particularly the freshmen casting their first vote  please vote for ethics today .,Democratic
do not vote against the constitution .,Democratic
vote for this house that you will love and revere as all of us do on both sides of the aisle .,Democratic
please vote no on the previous question and vote yes on the motion to recommit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
1630,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
dreier ) for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  my question to the gentleman concerns the change to the rules that would allow members to use campaign funds to purchase cell phones .,Democratic
as you know  there is a law that prohibits a member of congress from using the resources of their office or their office to solicit campaign funds .,Democratic
it is my hope that allowing campaign cell phones to be used in a congressional office is not in any way a back-door attempt to allow a member to use a campaign cell phone from their congressional office or any federal facility to raise funds to get around this prohibition that currently exists in law .,Democratic
just for a clarification  the use of a campaign cell phone in this building ?,Democratic
to solicit campaign funds with a campaign cell phone .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i realize that september 11 was a tragic day in america  certainly a wake-up call within the states .,Democratic
i also remind the members of this body that in the war of 1812 this building was occupied by a foreign army .,Democratic
so for the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
dreier ) xz4001150 to say that they could not have foreseen these circumstances taking place  what in the heck is he talking about ?,Democratic
this building was occupied and set on fire by a foreign army .,Democratic
and yet the congress at that time did not try to change the rules so that a minority within a minority could govern .,Democratic
if we are going to amend the constitution  the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
baird ) xz4000110 is exactly right : someone should offer a constitutional amendment .,Democratic
if we are going to change the law  then someone should offer a change to the law ; but let us not through the house rules try to rewrite the constitution of this nation .,Democratic
this nation has been around for a long time .,Democratic
it is going to be around for a long time  but only if we continue to do things as the founding fathers would have wanted us to do them and not some backdoor-approach like this .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased that the rules package includes a provision that will make the homeland security committee a permanent committee .,Democratic
more importantly  we will be giving the committee real oversight and legislative jurisdiction .,Democratic
but i am disappointed that the majority has only given shared jurisdiction to the homeland security committee in some areas .,Democratic
this creates the potential for ongoing turf battles that the 9/11 commission warned against .,Democratic
i am also discouraged that the majority has decided to add a third day of suspension bills to the legislative calendar each week .,Democratic
an increasing amount of legislation is being passed by the house under a suspension of the rules .,Democratic
this is unnecessary and keeps us from doing the real business of the house -- budgeting  appropriations and oversight .,Democratic
a perfect example of this is the massive omnibus appropriations bill passed for fiscal year 2005 just a few weeks ago .,Democratic
this bill was rushed to the floor  ignoring the house rule requiring a 3-day review period before voting on conference reports .,Democratic
only after the house voted on the bill  careful scrutiny of the language uncovered a provision allowing certain members and staff access to any american 's tax return .,Democratic
not only was this an embarrassing episode for the house leadership  it continued a troubling trend .,Democratic
in 4 out of the last 5 years  the majority has made a massive omnibus bill the only option to fund the government .,Democratic
this take-it-or-leave-it approach is not acceptable and is fiscally irresponsible .,Democratic
congress has also been asleep at the switch when it comes to funding for iraq and the war on terrorism .,Democratic
this administration continues to fund the war on terrorism by supplemental appropriations .,Democratic
this is not a temporary war .,Democratic
congress needs to stand up to this white house  stand up for honest budgeting  and require that funding for iraq and the war on terrorism be made on-budget  and through the regular appropriations process .,Democratic
by appropriating through omnibus bills and budgeting by supplemental  congress is surrendering its constitutional duties .,Democratic
the results of this practice are ballooning deficits -- the cbo confirmed that the 2004 deficit is the largest in history  $ 413 billion -- a lack of follow-through to determine how appropriated funds are being spent .,Democratic
without proper oversight as a backstop  problems in the executive branch can spin out of control .,Democratic
members are learning about problems for the first time through the newspapers  not as a result of tough oversight hearings .,Democratic
this kind of lax or nonexistent oversight contributes to situations like we saw in abu ghraib prison .,Democratic
now we have learned about secret  permanent detention facilities in the united states where possible terrorists are held indefinitely  without any legal status .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we need to take a hard look at our priorities and get back to doing the business of the house .,Democratic
we should be moving forward with a tough  focused oversight agenda  and a schedule that devotes more time to priority  must-pass legislation and less time to suspension bills .,Democratic
instead  it appears that we are adopting a rules package today that will bring us more of the same .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  an amendment was offered yesterday evening before the committee on rules that would have asked groups as well as individuals .,Democratic
we struck a portion of the language dealing with limiting this only to individuals .,Democratic
i would have asked  if that amendment had passed  would have enlarged the pool to groups as well .,Democratic
that was not passed in the committee on rules  and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision in it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i would like to express my disappointment that this legislation is not being offered under an open rule .,Democratic
in fact  the chairman of the full committee on financial services  the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
oxley ) xz4003070  who holds jurisdiction over this legislation  even requested during his committee on rules testimony last night a more open process for debate on this bill  and i thank the chairman for those comments .,Democratic
i would also like to take a moment to specifically thank and welcome our new committee on rules ranking member  my friend and colleague  the gentlewoman from new york ( ms.,Democratic
slaughter ) xz4003780  who will serve as a true and tireless fighter for democrats and our rights in the minority on the committee on rules over the next 2 years .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the bill we are debating today  h.r.,Democratic
54  the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005  while introduced in the previous congress  was never debated in committee because no hearings were convened  and no markup was held .,Democratic
and given that the committee on financial services has yet to even hold its organizational meeting for the 109th congress  the committee has obviously not yet had an opportunity to consider this issue carefully .,Democratic
in my view  we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem .,Democratic
having said that  democrats are open to debating and voting on this legislation .,Democratic
in the last several congresses  congressional gold medals have been considered in the house under a well-established and a bipartisan process that works well .,Democratic
regular order for consideration of gold medals involves the need  under the rules of the committee on financial services  to gain the cosponsorship of two-thirds of the house before the legislation is considered in committee  a full two-thirds sponsorship of the house before it is considered in committee .,Democratic
the bar for consideration for gold medals is set relatively high for a reason : gaining a two-thirds cosponsorship ensures that a solid bipartisan majority of the house is in full support of honoring a particularly noteworthy individual or individuals .,Democratic
under the rule today  i plan to offer two amendments .,Democratic
the first amendment would raise the number of gold medals from two per calendar year to six per congress  or an overall increase of two medals per congress .,Democratic
this is especially key  as in the 108th congress we awarded five congressional gold medals .,Democratic
they went to tony blair  the prime minister of great britain ; dr .,Democratic
dorothy height  president of the national council of negro women ; jackie robinson  the first black player in major league baseball ; the reverend dr .,Democratic
martin luther king  posthumously  and his widow coretta scott king  the civil rights icons ; and the posthumous awarding to reverend joseph a. delaine  harry and eliza briggs  and levi pearson  the leaders in our nation 's efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case brown et al .,Democratic
v. the board of education of topeka .,Democratic
my second amendment would provide for equitable distribution of gold medals between the majority and the minority .,Democratic
my amendments seek to maintain the spirit and process of bipartisanship that has characterized the house 's consideration of gold medals  the highest honor that this congress can bestow on an individual or group of individuals .,Democratic
it is my hope that the house will adopt these amendments to make this bill a better bill .,Democratic
stating that  though  i am dismayed that the committee on rules refused to allow consideration of a key amendment that would strike a section of the bill that only permits the granting of congressional gold medals to individuals .,Democratic
while i tend to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of a gold medal  there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others .,Democratic
in the last congress  we enacted into law legislation awarding the congressional gold medal posthumously  as i mentioned before  to reverend joseph a. delaine  harry and eliza briggs  and levi pearson in recognition of their contributions to the nation as pioneers in the effort to desegregate public schools that led directly to the landmark desegregation case of brown v. the board of ed .,Democratic
in previous congresses  the house has awarded gold medals to other groups  such as native american code talkers  who were critical to the safety of allied communications during world war ii ; to the little rock nine  the civil rights pioneers who led to the integration of our public schools ; and to ronald and nancy reagan  in honor of their contribution to our country .,Democratic
i fear that limiting gold medals to only individuals would also limit certain people from consideration who are most deserving of receiving one of our nation 's highest honors .,Democratic
for example  my good friend and republican colleague  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
king ) xz4002202 offered an amendment in the previous congress  which the house passed  to honor the officers  emergency workers  and other employees of the federal government and any state or local government  including any interstate governmental entity  who responded to the attacks on the world trade center in new york city and who perished in that attack on september 11 with a congressional gold medal .,Democratic
this would not be possible if this bill passed .,Democratic
and i would hope that my friend  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
king ) xz4002202  will oppose this bill  because if it were to pass  it would put an end to any opportunity to present the congressional gold medal to any of those heroes .,Democratic
again  while i urge my colleagues to support my two amendments that were made in order  i am dismayed that this third amendment was not made in order .,Democratic
if this bill were already law  congress would not have been able to issue the congressional medal of honor to the little rock nine or to the reagans .,Democratic
i feel this is a serious oversight in the base of this bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
in listening to the sponsor in terms of the need for this legislation  one could intimate by the introduction that possibly medals were given out in a haphazard manner .,Democratic
i mentioned before it takes two-thirds of the members of the house  the entire body  to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services  a bar that i believe is a very  very high bar and one that is not easily attained .,Democratic
i would also point out that limiting this to individuals  and again to reiterate  martin luther king and coretta scott king were both issued the gold medal .,Democratic
they would not have gotten that medal under this legislation .,Democratic
harry and eliza briggs  levi pearson  and reverend joseph armstrong delaine were all issued the medal in one provision .,Democratic
as mentioned before  nancy reagan  along with president reagan  would not have been eligible .,Democratic
under the provisions today  they would have to get it individually .,Democratic
betty and gerald ford  the little rock nine  and dr .,Democratic
graham and ruth graham would not have received it either .,Democratic
i think therein lies a tremendous flaw .,Democratic
it also intimates that there may be too many of these gold medals given out .,Democratic
who that received this medal in the past was not worthy of it ?,Democratic
was it dr .,Democratic
martin luther king and coretta scott king ; was it reverend delaine  harry and eliza briggs  and levi pearson ; was it jackie robinson ; was it dorothy height ; tony blair in the last congress ?,Democratic
in the 106th congress was it nancy reagan ; was it pope john paul  ii ; was it charles schulz  the great cartoonist ?,Democratic
was it rosa parks ?,Democratic
who amongst those was not qualified  who do we believe was not deserving of this medal .,Democratic
therein lies the flaw in this bill .,Democratic
it actually limits us from giving to those who i believe are most deserving of recognition of this gold medal .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if the gentleman will continue to yield  that is the point i am trying to make .,Democratic
to say that the code talkers  and i am not saying the gentleman is suggesting this  but to suggest that they did not deserve the ultimate award  even as a group  for what they provided to the service of this country during world war ii is just ridiculous .,Democratic
they certainly deserved as a group .,Democratic
any one individual  no .,Democratic
there were multiple individuals who provided an incredible service to us .,Democratic
i would also point out that two is not individual .,Democratic
two individuals makes up a group  to my understanding  and that would include nancy and ronald reagan .,Democratic
that would include any husband and wife  including dr .,Democratic
king and coretta scott king .,Democratic
that would preclude them from getting this medal in the future .,Democratic
that is my understanding of the legislation before us .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
delahunt ) xz4001020 .,Democratic
if the gentleman will yield further  let me just make a point .,Democratic
i appreciate what the gentleman from delaware has said .,Democratic
the reality is  though  a country of 300 million people  only 20 medals have been awarded in the past decade .,Democratic
that is not an awful lot of medals .,Democratic
the point that the gentleman is making is that it has been extraordinary when we have actually issued this medal to groups .,Democratic
why are we now limiting ourselves ; when it is extraordinary  recognized as extraordinary  why are we now officially and legally limiting the ability of congress to issue this medal to groups ?,Democratic
i do not understand that .,Democratic
we understand the process is hard .,Democratic
the gentleman has just said himself to get two-thirds of the members of this house truly requires bipartisanship to get this done .,Democratic
this is not done  as i mentioned before  in a willy-nilly manner .,Democratic
there is great effort involved .,Democratic
i understand it .,Democratic
i remember when my friend from new york ( mr.,Democratic
fossella ) xz4001390 was doing this for john cardinal o'connor and the effort that it took to get both sides to get enough members to sign onto that .,Democratic
i do understand the difficulties in that  but i hope the gentleman understands the appreciation that has been set forth by my testimony here today as well as my good friend from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 that sometimes  not ofttimes  it is not just individuals  but it is groups who are responsible for incredible  incredible events in this country and i believe are deserving of the congressional gold medal .,Democratic
i hope that the gentleman would agree with that and we will have a motion to recommit that will  if passed  put this back to committee and will strike that language limiting it only to individuals .,Democratic
mr. chairman  would it be safe to say under regular order if this legislation were passed that the code talkers  under regular order  and that was an extraordinary provision made in the appropriations process  under regular order would they be eligible to receive this medal in the future if this bill were to pass ?,Democratic
not to prolong the debate  either  because i know we want to move on  but since 1999 when we passed the coin act  there have been some concerns on our side of the aisle .,Democratic
i know that one of the amendments your side has accepted  or that was accepted in the rules committee  it remains to be seen whether it passes or not  that would evenly divide the number of gold medals  that did not exist in the coin bill that passed .,Democratic
overwhelmingly it has been one side .,Democratic
in terms of bipartisanship  it has not been very bipartisan in terms of coins that have been established .,Democratic
according to our records  15 out of the 16 coin bills that were passed were sponsored by republicans .,Democratic
i do not think that is just going to happen under this legislation .,Democratic
that is also  i think  some of the fear in terms of changing the rules  for lack of a better word  on the gold medal has stirred up consternation on our side of the aisle .,Democratic
i offer that as well .,Democratic
i recognize that the minting of a coin is a way that we can bring recognition to individuals and to groups .,Democratic
i just do not think that we should be limiting ourselves as the house of representatives and as a congress in reducing our leverage or our ability to honor groups of individuals who have done incredible  incredible works on behalf of this nation .,Democratic
i think that is what that provision of the bill will actually end up doing is limiting  tying our hands from honoring groups in the form of the congressional gold medal .,Democratic
that is why i stand in opposition to that .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
something that is not often highlighted outside the hall is that there are actually friendships between democrats and republicans  and mr.,Democratic
oxley xz4003070 and i share that .,Democratic
i would like to point out for the record though that he is extremely partisan when it comes to congressional baseball  and i hope that next year he gives the democrats an opportunity to have a win .,Democratic
having said that  i have no objections to this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself as much time as i may consume .,Democratic
this amendment is a simple and fair amendment that would increase the maximum number of congressional gold medals that congress could award from two per calendar year to six per congress  an increase of two medals per congress .,Democratic
the reason for this amendment was best summed up by the republican rules committee member  the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Democratic
gingrey ) xz4001510 last night during his questioning of chairman oxley .,Democratic
he had concerns that the bill in its current form would make members hesitate before introducing their own congressional gold medal bills until late in the first year  waiting to see if others had more noteworthy recipients  then late in the first year rushing to introduce i too share some of those concerns and believe we can address this by passing this amendment .,Democratic
this would allow for the passage of six medals over the life of a congress instead of two per year over the life of a calendar year .,Democratic
i believe that members on both sides would prefer the flexibility of having more rather than fewer possibilities to award gold medals to citizens who deserve to be bestowed with one of our nation 's highest honors .,Democratic
but this higher number does not cheapen the medal because of the high threshold needed for consideration  two-thirds of the chamber .,Democratic
foolish medal bills will not attract the support that they would need for consideration .,Democratic
finally  this amendment is needed in the most practical purpose yet .,Democratic
in the last congress we awarded five congressional gold medals .,Democratic
they went to tony blair  prime minister of great britain  dr .,Democratic
dorothy height  president of the national council of negro women  jackie robinson  the first black player in major league baseball  reverend dr .,Democratic
martin luther king  jr.  posthumously and his wife coretta scott king  the civil rights icons  and posthumously awarded to the reverend joseph a. delaine  harry and eliza briggs  and levi pearson  the leaders in our nation 's efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case of brown versus the board of ed .,Democratic
additionally  we granted six medals in the 106th congress and six in the 105th congress .,Democratic
in the 106th congress we passed into law three democratic sponsored bills and three republican sponsored bills .,Democratic
they went to ronald and nancy reagan  pope john paul ii  charles schulz  john cardinal o'connor  theodore hesburgh  rosa parks .,Democratic
and in the 105th congress two democratic sponsored bills and four republican sponsored bills for medals became law .,Democratic
gerald and betty ford  the little rock 9  nelson mandela  to the patriarch bartholomew  to mother teresa of calcutta and to frank sinatra  introduced by my colleague  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
serrano ) xz4003660 .,Democratic
this amendment is about flexibility for members  the ability to debate and consider legislation over the entire congress just as we do with every other piece of legislation .,Democratic
it will not cheapen but rather enhance this most prestigious of american honors .,Democratic
in fact  the existing committee on financial services rule requiring two-thirds cosponsorship of the house for a gold medal  which by definition represents broad-based bipartisan support  prevents the awarding of frivolous and undeserved medals to groups of individuals .,Democratic
i trust that two-thirds of the house represents a solid bipartisan consensus of the will of the house and therefore believe that this acts as a check on any effort to award medals to any groups of individuals who in the opinion of the house do not deserve such award .,Democratic
i urge the acceptance of this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the sponsor made compelling arguments that the amendment is reasonable .,Democratic
therefore  one would conclude that if it is reasonable and compelling arguments are made that there would be bipartisan support for the amendment .,Democratic
unfortunately  that is not going to be the case .,Democratic
i hope that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  though  do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments  that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted in favor of .,Democratic
and i hope that my colleagues on the other side as well as my side of the aisle view it the same way .,Democratic
mr. chairman i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i am disappointed that the chairman will not support this amendment .,Democratic
i think it is a reasonable amendment  one that i do not think in any way disrupts what the intention of the bill by the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700  the sponsor  is  that is  to limit the number .,Democratic
we certainly are limiting the number in this amendment to six as opposed to what the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700 would do per calendar year  which would be four .,Democratic
we are still limiting it to six .,Democratic
i think in the most recent history  we have not done more than six within a congress .,Democratic
this again will help to free the hands of members to introduce gold medal legislation for people who they believe are worthy of that great honor .,Democratic
i would just like to point out again that the founding fathers in their wisdom did not have as many people that they had to honor during that time .,Democratic
we have grown more than tenfold since the founding of this nation .,Democratic
there have been many more events that have taken place since the founding fathers initially granted those initial gold medals  and i think that once again if we do not pass this  we will further be limiting our ability to ensure that those who are most deserving will receive this great honor .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i appreciate the comments of my colleague  the chairman of the committee .,Democratic
just to add that  yes  we do work in a very bipartisan way .,Democratic
if the chairman and i were making decisions as to who would receive the gold medal  i think we would work it out amongst ourselves to make sure that it was done in a very bipartisan way .,Democratic
that  unfortunately  has not been the history of the house  and i just point out  for instance  as i mentioned earlier  back when we created the commemorative coin legislation in 1999  out of the 16 coins that have been created  15 have been introduced by republican members  only one by the minority .,Democratic
the majority has had 15 of the 16 .,Democratic
the minority has had one .,Democratic
i do not think that is a very fair and balanced way in which we can collectively and bipartisanly recognize those who have made tremendous sacrifices or achievements or contributed to this country .,Democratic
and i believe that we are limiting it to  in this case  this legislation  if passed the way it does  four congressional gold medals that we in the minority may very well find ourselves in a very difficult position in that we may not have any of our honorees awarded the medal even though we go through the process of collecting the two-thirds .,Democratic
it then becomes a political decision as to which honorees will get the gold medal in that particular year and which will not .,Democratic
for instance  if there are 16 individuals who are sponsored by members of the house and those individuals get two-thirds of the signatures required  which of the 16 will get the four medals ?,Democratic
which of those 16 ?,Democratic
that decision will be made based on a political decision that is made within the house  and i dare say that outside influence would also come to bear on that decision that was made as well .,Democratic
that is why i am asking for this fair and balanced approach ; that if we are going to limit it to just four  that it will be two per year .,Democratic
i do not think it is unreasonable to ask that it is done in this way .,Democratic
quite frankly  if there is someone that the democratic side of the aisle  if we have used up our one per year and we have another extraordinary person  i think we can work with each other to ask a republican member of the house to sponsor that bill .,Democratic
and vice versa .,Democratic
if we somehow find we have run out of opportunities on our side to introduce legislation  i do not think it is unusual to ask a member of the other side of the aisle to sponsor the bill .,Democratic
that is the spirit in which i think we can work in a bipartisan way to ensure that every person who receives this gold medal  besides getting a two-thirds vote  it is done in a bipartisan way .,Democratic
i do not think this is frivolous  and i do not think this trivial .,Democratic
that is why i offered the amendment  and i hope we pass it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
unfortunately  i think that in the past there may have been some politics involved .,Democratic
i understand that one of my colleagues on this side had achieved the requisite number of signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia 107 in the last congress  in the middle of the last congress  and that was never awarded .,Democratic
so i do not know why .,Democratic
i do not know if there was any reason for that  when the requisite number of signatures were given  that that bill was not taken up in the committee and that member was not successful in getting that award to the columbia 107 .,Democratic
why that was not done  i do not know .,Democratic
i do not know if politics was part of that .,Democratic
maybe someone can answer that question .,Democratic
but therein lies the problem  that from time to time  quite possibly there is politics involved as to why some individuals receive the gold medals and others do not .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if the gentleman will yield further  the rules will have changed once we pass this bill  whereas right now it is unlimited .,Democratic
granted  where it is unlimited  there has not been this rush to introduce bills .,Democratic
as the gentleman mentioned before  this is not done in a very quick fashion .,Democratic
this is done in a bipartisan way .,Democratic
but when we limit it to two per year  we are putting a cap on it  i think we can in the future find ourselves in a situation where  all right maybe five on each side is a little much  maybe two on each side .,Democratic
then which of the four ?,Democratic
who makes that decision as to which of the four gets the medal ?,Democratic
and therein lies the politics .,Democratic
unfortunately  i think you are creating more politics in this bill .,Democratic
i do not think that is your intent .,Democratic
i think you are doing this because you want to enrich the value of the gold medal .,Democratic
i understand that .,Democratic
but i think inherently by the changes being proposed  you are bringing more politics into the decisionmaking as to who obtains this medal .,Democratic
that is what i am trying to in a sense  avoid by evenly dividing between democrat and republican  majority  minority  the ability for both sides to equally participate in this process .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote  and pending that  i make the point of order that a quorum is not present .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote  and pending that  i make the point of order that a quorum is not present .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to recognize the significance of this medal  that it is not given out willy-nilly ; that  as i mentioned before  it takes extraordinary measures to get enough support to get this medal passed .,Democratic
i recognize that the first person who received this medal was general george washington  prior to him becoming president of the united states  when the country was brand new  when we did not have the richness of diversity and of events that have taken place throughout the history of our country ever since this first medal was given to george washington ; that we have grown as a nation  in size and in stature ; and that there have been many events that have occurred throughout our history since the striking of the first medal that have inured greatly to the advancement of our country that from time to time need to be recognized .,Democratic
that is what this medal gives an opportunity to do  both to individuals and to groups .,Democratic
certainly general washington was an incredible individual  someone who was deserving of the first medal that was ever produced  and i think he accepted that on behalf of all those men and women who fought for independence from great britain back during the war of independence .,Democratic
but certainly we have grown in size  both in states  from thirteen colonies and states to 50 states  and the number of people in this country have grown incredibly since the founding of this nation  and the events that have occurred throughout our history has certainly changed the shape of the distribution of this medal as well .,Democratic
i think that needs to be recognized and taken into consideration .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and i thank my friend  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670  for yielding me the time .,Democratic
it is a new year  mr.,Democratic
speaker  a new congress and new presidential term .,Democratic
we have heard new commitments to work across party lines and calls for civility and camaraderie in the halls of the capitol .,Democratic
we have heard the president speak of a more civilized washington and a bipartisan approach to the legislative process .,Democratic
then and now congress starts its work .,Democratic
the rhetoric starts ; reality sets in .,Democratic
we are not even 2 full weeks into the house legislative calendar  and it is starting to sound like the same old song and dance .,Democratic
any way we look at it  mr.,Democratic
speaker  process or policy  the house is off to a bad start .,Democratic
it is the first day of normal legislative business in the 109th congress  and the house is already considering a restrictive rule for a bill that has not gone through proper house procedures .,Democratic
new congress members just coming from parliamentary procedure training session must be doing a double-take .,Democratic
they just spent a week in a refresher course on how a bill becomes a law .,Democratic
then  all of the sudden  that process has not been followed on one of their first votes .,Democratic
i guess i was confused  too  and what i can say to them is  welcome to washington .,Democratic
the proponents of the underlying legislation will try to argue that it is not a new bill because it was first introduced in the 108th congress .,Democratic
while that might be true  the committee on financial services did not act on the bill in the 108th congress  and it has not acted on it in this year .,Democratic
i ask  why is the full house considering a relatively controversial piece of legislation without any committee action ?,Democratic
why the rush ?,Democratic
why set such a precedent for the 109th congress ' beginning ?,Democratic
the committee on financial services  the committee of jurisdiction for the underlying legislation  will not even organize itself until next week  let alone hold a hearing or markup on my good friend 's  and he is my good friend  the gentleman from delaware 's bill .,Democratic
think about it this way : the first bill that the house is considering in the 109th congress under normal rules actually makes it harder to pass legislation and create laws honoring our country 's greatest heroes .,Democratic
just like social security  some of my republican friends are trying to create a problem where one does not exist .,Democratic
as the gentleman from texas already noted  the rule does make in order two amendments offered by my good friend  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
crowley ) xz4000870 .,Democratic
the first crowley amendment increases the total number of medals of honor to be permitted awarded from four to six per congress .,Democratic
the second crowley amendment provides for an equitable distribution of gold medals between the majority and the minority .,Democratic
while i intend to support both of these amendments  and certainly appreciate them being made in order  the committee on rules failed to make in order a third crowley amendment which would have maintained the status quo .,Democratic
that amendment would have ensured that worthy groups or individuals and organizations remain eligible to receive the congressional medal of honor .,Democratic
the committee on rules also rejected along a party-line vote an amendment to the rule which would have made it open to all germane amendments .,Democratic
if the underlying legislation were to become law  president and nancy reagan never would have received the medal because they received it as a couple .,Democratic
neither would dr .,Democratic
martin luther king and coretta scott king  joseph delaine and harry and eliza briggs  billy and ruth graham  president and betty ford  the navajo code talkers or the american red cross  just to name a few .,Democratic
can anyone in this body honestly suggest that the individuals aforementioned and organizations are unworthy of this institution 's top award ?,Democratic
is there an epidemic of distributing too many congressional medals of honor to unworthy recipients that somehow or another has escaped at least me in knowing about them ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am not worried about congress going on a spree to award the medal of honor to unworthy recipients .,Democratic
the rules applied by the committee on financial services to even consider a bill awarding the congressional medal of honor are so stringent that the integrity and prestige of the award will always be protected .,Democratic
on the contrary  if today is any indication  perhaps we ought to be just a bit more concerned about the integrity of procedure in the house of representatives than about the integrity of a system that is dependent upon bipartisan cooperation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i appreciate my colleague on the other side .,Democratic
it is the pay grade issue i am concerned about  as the gentleman mentioned  as to who makes these decisions and as to why some individuals are successful in garnering a gold medal for an individual or group  and maybe another is not .,Democratic
there is some political judgment that is made as well  i believe .,Democratic
as the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700 said  there is a process that will begin after this legislation is passed  nuances that members will work through .,Democratic
i would just offer  if this amendment were to pass  they would work through these nuances .,Democratic
as i mentioned before  if two gold medals were enacted into law by democrats and i had a third that i wanted to get passed  i would go to the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700 and say  mike  we do not have any more room on our side .,Democratic
here is an opportunity ; someone is deserving .,Democratic
would you consider sponsoring this and passing it ?,Democratic
i think  quite frankly  if there was a compelling argument  the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700 would say  certainly  joe crowley .,Democratic
we will do it .,Democratic
that is a nuance to work through as well in terms of working in a bipartisan way .,Democratic
this simply ensures that both republicans and democrats are working in a bipartisan way  beyond the two-thirds vote ; that medals are not being used for political purposes  but are being given because the individuals deserve them .,Democratic
that is what we are trying to do with this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  today we begin the 109th congress in earnest  and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act on for a problem that  in our view and in the view of many of my colleagues  simply does not exist .,Democratic
we considered this bill today not in the spirit of openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate in the house  but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate on a key issue : whether one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon citizens of our country for their extraordinary deeds  a congressional gold medal  can be awarded to one individual or more for their collective honorable or heroic actions .,Democratic
mr. speaker  if this bill passes in its current form  not only would it limit medals to two per year  but it would prevent the house of representatives and the senate from awarding medals in the future to any group of individuals for their collective heroic deeds  such as those of the hundreds of first responders that perished in the 9/11 terrorist attacks .,Democratic
i am puzzled why we would act to impose such limits on our own ability to recognize the accomplishments of the citizens that we are elected to represent .,Democratic
and i am even more puzzled that we would fix a process that is not broken  that is bipartisan in nature  and that works remarkably well for all members .,Democratic
the bipartisan process we have in place has allowed us to honor the reverend martin luther king and coretta scott king ; nancy and ronald reagan ; betty and gerald ford ; pope john paul ii ; the little rock nine ; the leaders of brown v. the board of education ; jackie robinson ; civil rights leader dorothy height ; the navajo code talkers ; general henry shelton ; charles schulz ; john cardinal o'connor  archbishop of new york ; father theodore hesburgh ; rosa parks ; nelson mandela ; mother teresa ; frank sinatra ; ruth and billy graham ; ecumenical patriarch bartholomew ; british prime minister tony blair ; and others .,Democratic
but under this bill  mr.,Democratic
speaker  we may not be able to honor nancy and ronald reagan jointly  nor betty and gerald ford jointly  nor martin luther king and coretta scott king jointly  nor the little rock nine  nor the navajo code talkers .,Democratic
and under this bill my colleague  the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990  will be prevented from honoring the fallen astronauts from the space shuttle columbia .,Democratic
in the 108th congress the gentlewoman from texas worked hard to gain the requisite two-thirds cosponsorship of the house for a bill that would honor these fallen american heroes posthumously with the congressional gold medal .,Democratic
it is only right that the rule of the house be honored and that her hard-won efforts be not undone by this bill .,Democratic
since the majority party gained control of this house in 1995  20 gold medals have been enacted into law either to an individual or a group of individuals .,Democratic
using the process we currently have in place  10 gold medal bills out of 20 were sponsored by republican members  and 10 were sponsored by democratic members .,Democratic
how can anyone possibly argue that the existing process does not work ?,Democratic
we are fixing something that simply is not broken .,Democratic
unfortunately  the bipartisan spirit that has characterized the house 's consideration of gold medals in the past has not carried over to the debate on this bill .,Democratic
not only did we do not have an open rule  but today represents the first time this house is debating this issue in any form .,Democratic
the committee responsible for legislation on this bill  the committee on financial services  on which i serve  has not held a single hearing on this bill  let alone a markup .,Democratic
the limited debate over this bill on the house floor may culminate in the passing of a bad bill  unless my colleagues join me in voting in favor of sending this bill back to committee  where we can have a meaningful debate  and where we can determine whether limiting gold medals is truly in the interest of the public and in the interest of the house .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the house has become the 109th congress on a bad note : we are considering a bill with almost no meaningful debate  and it proposes to represent a solution to a problem that simply does not exist  a problem the record shows does not exist .,Democratic
does this action foretell what lies ahead in terms of the existence of bipartisanship throughout this congress ?,Democratic
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing  to vote in favor of my motion to recommit this bill back to the committee on financial services and to allow this house to take a closer look at this legislation to determine whether it really meets the interests of the american people .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am privileged to announce that we have no further speakers  and i would say to my good friend  the gentleman from texas  we yield back the balance of our time .,Democratic
yes  i am opposed to the bill in its current form .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the angst that i have with h.r.,Democratic
54 does not speak to the eloquence that we have heard on the floor about our commitment to honoring our heroes and sheroes .,Democratic
let me make it perfectly clear  despite all of the accolades that we have spoken today  if this legislation were in place  president reagan and mrs.,Democratic
reagan would not receive the congressional gold medal ; neither would dr .,Democratic
king and mrs.,Democratic
coretta scott king ; neither would the indian code talkers who helped save thousands of lives in world war ii .,Democratic
i think that is the crux of this debate  not whether or not we have restrictions or nonrestrictions because i believe it is a given that the committee on financial services has done a commendable job in its oversight .,Democratic
as i look back on the numbers in the last four congresses  how interesting it is and the good sense of the crowley amendment because those that have been passed by this body only equal to five or six credible  rational and reasonable reasoning for awarding  for example  those who were intimately involved in brown v. board of education that changed the lives of millions of americans and today even is a standard for equal education in america .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am confused by the necessity of this legislation and why we would not be able to enthusiastically support the very precise  as i said previously  and thoughtful amendments by the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
crowley ) xz4000870  particularly those dealing with the idea of the number of gold medals  increasing them to six per congress .,Democratic
that is 2 years  that means three and three possibly  or however it is broken down  and then the fairness of equal distribution between republicans and democrats  all of us  of course  being americans .,Democratic
what is to argue the case or why would we argue the case that there were those who contributed together who are not worthy .,Democratic
i do not take this as any kind of personal act by my republican friends  but i do think it is a misstep in judgment and that we would have benefited from a more bipartisan overview  review of this legislation .,Democratic
for example  we would not have been able to honor  as some americans perceive as very important  ruth and billy graham .,Democratic
so this narrow or narrowing or this interpretation of one hero when there may be an adequate partnering that may be important that would symbolize the greatness and goodness of america puzzles me and  in fact  disturbs me .,Democratic
frankly  the civil rights movement was a group effort and it might be likely that one would want to honor the group of civil rights activists  the unknown  the unsung heroes that we are able to bring to the attention of the united states congress .,Democratic
how many really knew harry and eliza briggs ?,Democratic
how many knew levi pearson ?,Democratic
but once we debated and found out the facts  we knew that they were in fact heroes and sheroes .,Democratic
i think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by coming down hard-handed on who has given so much for america .,Democratic
and then i would say why start with divisive legislation .,Democratic
yes  there are only a few of us on the floor of the house  but we obviously are not able to speak for all of those unsung heroes yet to be brought to the attention of this house .,Democratic
all of us come in our course of life to meet people in our districts and around the country where we claim that we want to bring them to the attention of the american people not frivolously ; but after we have looked at the history  we know they are truly worthy of a congressional gold medal .,Democratic
so why we need this restrictive law that has not already been satisfied by the oversight of a bipartisan committee on financial services and the requirement  mr.,Democratic
chairman  the requirement of over 290 signatures  and most of these received close to 400 .,Democratic
and that is the test  whether your colleagues will support you .,Democratic
mr. chairman  in support of the gentleman 's two amendments  i am querying as to the amendment offered which would really balance this legislation which would speak to protect president reagan and dr .,Democratic
and mrs.,Democratic
billy graham and others who came together .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from new york .,Democratic
mr. chairman  on rollcall no .,Democratic
11  crowley no .,Democratic
3  had i been present  i would have voted `` aye .,Democratic
'',Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for his leadership and simply say that is the spirit of bipartisanship .,Democratic
that would have been reflective of members having an opportunity in their wisdom to present their case before the united states congress and the committee on financial services .,Democratic
that would have been fairness to the unsung heroes .,Democratic
that would have been in respect to president and mrs.,Democratic
reagan  dr .,Democratic
king and mrs.,Democratic
king  dr .,Democratic
graham and mrs.,Democratic
graham  as well as many others .,Democratic
i ask my colleagues to vote against this legislation  allow us to work in a bipartisan manner and do not take away from those as yet unrecognized the honor of a congressional gold medal .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the bill before the committee of the whole because it is unreasonably restrictive .,Democratic
its passage will result in the preclusion of our ability to pay tribute to americans in the most respectful manner .,Democratic
the central amendment that would have made this legislation palatable at the very least and not so disrespectful to the heroes that we strive to honor with the congressional gold medal has been effectively blocked by partisan stubbornness .,Democratic
if the import of this legislation is good  why not allow the representatives of this august body to openly debate it before the american people ?,Democratic
are we so ashamed of its true legislative intent that we feel the need to hide behind obstructionist rules ?,Democratic
i say that legislation with bona fide purpose should have nothing to fear -- at the very least should it fear honest and open debate .,Democratic
the underlying legislation that is before this house seeks to `` provide reasonable standards for congressional gold medals '' but will essentially limit the bestowal of honor to american icons .,Democratic
one of the main reasons that the medal is bestowed is to make the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
54 will summarily restrict this goal and prevent many honored heroes from receiving proper recognition .,Democratic
section 2  paragraph ( e ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of h.r.,Democratic
54 would limit the striking of a congressional gold medal to `` only an individual.,Democratic
'' such `` unreasonably '' restrictive legislation would preclude the bestowal of this award collectively to the 9 students who `` voluntarily subjected themselves to racial bigotry during the integration of central high school in little rock  arkansas  otherwise known as the `` little rock nine.,Democratic
'' similarly  under this restrictive provision  the secretary of the treasury can not lawfully strike a congressional gold medal to honor former president ronald reagan and his wife nancy reagan in recognition of their services to america or to honor former president jimmy carter and his wife rosalynn carter .,Democratic
furthermore  h.r.,Democratic
54 would make it illegal for congress to cause the secretary to strike a congressional gold medal to honor the monumental contributions made to the civil rights movement by dr .,Democratic
martin luther king  jr .,Democratic
and his widow  coretta scott king  or the brave employees and others who responded to the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon and perished and to the people aboard united airlines flight 93 who resisted hijackers and caused the plane to crash .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i oppose this legislation and ask that my colleagues join me to defeat it unless the overly restrictive provisions are fixed or removed .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i hope that this amendment would also be received as reasonable and with cogent arguments .,Democratic
my second amendment made in order under the rule would allow for the equitable distribution of these medals between the majority and the minority .,Democratic
since the 104th congress  24 gold medal resolutions became law .,Democratic
using the process currently in place that has worked so well for us  the two parties in the house have evenly split sponsorship of these medals .,Democratic
republican members have sponsored 10 medals and democratic members have also sponsored 10 medals .,Democratic
in fact  this amendment probably makes more sense with republican support in it than democrats  as in the 108th congress  five congressional medals were awarded and four of those were sponsored by democrats  only one by a republican .,Democratic
but i offer this amendment out of basic fairness for both sides .,Democratic
i  therefore  believe if we are to limit the number of gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process  my amendment should be passed by the chamber  my fear being that if we limit it to only four  then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four  and we in the minority may find ourselves on the short end of that stick .,Democratic
and that is why i offer this amendment .,Democratic
i hope that the members will agree to accept this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to this resolution .,Democratic
it may seem peculiar  but  frankly  i think that the military does not need this resolution .,Democratic
it is not broken out there .,Democratic
they are having the ability to recruit .,Democratic
even despite the negative news from iraq  the recruitment numbers are up for all the services .,Democratic
what this resolution does is sort of breaks this feeling in america that democracy allows divergence of opinion and that the people that own the real estate should have a voice in who can visit that real estate .,Democratic
we do not have any nationally owned universities  yet this resolution requires equal access for all military recruiters at institutions of higher education .,Democratic
i think we are getting into a really slippery area here because you are going to create within those campuses huge debates that students are going to say  we do n't like this stuff being jammed down our throats .,Democratic
we and the faculty and the trustees of a university ought to be able to decide who can visit our campus  as they do in all other things .,Democratic
for example  here in washington  d.c.  catholic university does not allow pro-abortionist recruiters to come and talk on the campus  and here you are going to require  regardless of what the issue should be  that military recruiters have to be allowed on campus .,Democratic
i think it is a very slippery slope .,Democratic
i do not think we need to go there  because the recruitment numbers are not down .,Democratic
i think the military has historically stood on its own feet to do very well in recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be on campuses .,Democratic
i think you are going to have a negative reaction .,Democratic
i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote `` no '' until we get a better thought on how we want to mandate democracy in this country .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i come to the floor today in strong opposition to h. con .,Democratic
res.,Democratic
36 .,Democratic
it is a standard practice for institutions of higher learning to include a non-discrimination policy as part of their mission .,Democratic
these policies affirm that they do not tolerate discrimination on any number of issues : race  sex  religion  age  disability  social class  and sexual orientation .,Democratic
these non-discrimination policies were created so that all people in our country have the opportunity to be an equal and respected member of higher education communities .,Democratic
unfortunately the military has established a discriminatory policy  do n't ask do n't tell .,Democratic
this policy unfairly excludes homosexuals from military service on the basis of their sexual orientation alone .,Democratic
for example  numerous military linguists who are critically needed in the global war on terrorism have been discharged under do n't ask do n't tell .,Democratic
supporters of h. con .,Democratic
res.,Democratic
36 say that denying military recruiters access to college campuses is a national security threat  but they are completely missing the big picture .,Democratic
the real national security threat is the do n't ask do n't tell policy that forces our military to discharge gay servicemen and servicewomen regardless of their job performance .,Democratic
i strongly believe that the non-discrimination policies of colleges and universities should be respected and i urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida and ranking member  and the gentleman representing the committee on rules on the republican side and also the author of this legislation .,Democratic
i rise to oppose the rule and the underlying legislation for some of the very reasons that my good friend and colleague from florida has enunciated .,Democratic
i also raise another question  that this body is the people 's house and the people represent a wide diversity of america  heroes and sheroes  little unknown to many of us until they rise and shine .,Democratic
it is interesting that this legislation would come without going to the full committee in this session to be able to have the oversight of the committee structure  and then to be reminded of the fact that we took great joy and pleasure in honoring both president reagan and mrs.,Democratic
reagan  dr .,Democratic
king and mrs.,Democratic
king  and of course  legislation that i proposed to acknowledge the columbia seven that tragically lost their lives on our behalf as astronauts and heroes in space .,Democratic
all right .,Democratic
i recognize that judgment is necessary  but this legislation does not speak to judgment .,Democratic
it speaks to denial  and it denies the congress its authoritative right to make decisions on who has represented america in the most honorable way to deserve a congressional gold medal .,Democratic
the legislation that i have has over 320-plus sponsors out of 435 and growing .,Democratic
individual members acquiesced and affirmed the fact that these individuals were worthy of a congressional gold medal .,Democratic
i agree  as well  that the committee on financial services has put in place a very effective  very effective oversight of this process .,Democratic
let me thank the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
crowley ) xz4000870 for his insight in his amendments that would expand the numbers for the congressional session and also bifurcate or equalize the numbers for each party .,Democratic
i  too  believe that there should be restraint in judgment  but i believe as well that america has her heroes and sheroes and who are we in 2005 to predict what might happen in 2010 or 2015 or 2020 where there may be a multitude of heroes who americans believe are deserving of this worthy award .,Democratic
i am disappointed and saddened that this could not be a bipartisan process .,Democratic
i  for one  believe that we should overwhelmingly vote against the rule and overwhelmingly vote against this intrusion into the objective and the precise and the bipartisan decisions that have been made on ronald reagan and mrs.,Democratic
reagan  the president of the united states ; dr .,Democratic
king and mrs.,Democratic
king  very surely representatives of the human and american spirit .,Democratic
i would ask my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and most specifically because it violated  if you will  the precise rules that we adhere to  oversight by committees  the committee on rules ' involvement in an open rule  and the bipartisan spirit in which we honor our heroes and sheroes  whether dead or alive .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the overly restrictive rule that has been reported out of committee relating to h.r.,Democratic
54 .,Democratic
despite my disappointment and dismay at not only the criteria of this rule but the nature of the underlying legislation  i am pleased that two amendments offered by my colleague from new york  mr.,Democratic
crowley were made in order .,Democratic
the central amendment that would have made this legislation palatable at the very least and not so disrespectful to the heroes that we strive to honor with the congressional gold medal has been effectively blocked by partisan stubbornness .,Democratic
if the import of this legislation is good  why not allow the representatives of this august body to openly debate it before the american people ?,Democratic
are we so ashamed of its true legislative intent that we feel the need to hide behind obstructionist rules ?,Democratic
i say that legislation with bona fide purpose should have nothing to fear -- at the very least should it fear honest and open debate .,Democratic
the underlying legislation that is before this house seeks to `` provide reasonable standards for congressional gold medals '' but will essentially limit the bestowal of honor to american icons .,Democratic
one of the main reasons that the medal is bestowed is to make the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
54 will summarily restrict this goal and prevent many honored heroes from receiving proper recognition .,Democratic
blocking debate on a provision that is utterly unreasonable is disrespectful to the constituents that members seek to honor with the congressional gold medal .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i oppose this rule and i urge my colleagues to defeat it .,Democratic
to begin  mr.,Democratic
speaker  it is absolutely backwards to decry this policy of excluding recruiters from using the facilities of a university .,Democratic
let us be clear : no university can ban a recruiter from coming to that city or that town .,Democratic
no university can say that students will not talk to the recruiter .,Democratic
the question is not whether the recruiters can come and advertise ; it is whether they can compel the university to offer its facilities involving a policy with which they disagree .,Democratic
but to say that that causes a problem in getting people in the military  it is the supporters of a policy that say to able-bodied men and women  we disapprove of your sexuality  and  therefore  no matter how talented you are  no matter how patriotic you are  no matter what skills you bring  you are not allowed here .,Democratic
colin powell  when he was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  testified before this congress that there was no argument that gay and lesbian men and women in the military were in any way deficient as members of the military .,Democratic
he made it clear .,Democratic
the only reason for excluding them was the prejudice of others .,Democratic
that was the only reason .,Democratic
the argument was : if you let these people in  and he said they had been good soldiers and good airmen and good sailors  it would be disruptive .,Democratic
well  one  that was 15 years ago when he said that .,Democratic
i think society has moved some .,Democratic
but  second  we have experience to the contrary .,Democratic
i know there have been people critical of the israeli defense forces in some respects .,Democratic
i think they deserve  on the whole  a lot of credit for a difficult job .,Democratic
in the israeli defense forces  people serve who are openly gay and lesbian .,Democratic
so the argument that somehow allowing people who are honest about their sexuality  if they are gay or lesbian  to serve in the military makes you an ineffectual military  how do they explain the israeli defense forces ?,Democratic
in fact  what we are again being told is that good people  able people  and we heard reference to the linguists .,Democratic
this has become the policy of `` do n't ask  do n't tell  and by no means translate.,Democratic
'' you who support this policy are the ones  mr.,Democratic
speaker  who are depriving the armed services of able-bodied people .,Democratic
you are the ones who have driven thousands  literally thousands of perfectly capable men and women out of the military because you disapprove of what they do in their spare time .,Democratic
so then to claim that it is the universities trying to stand up for a principle that are weakening the military gets it absolutely backwards .,Democratic
i was also saddened  i must say  by one of the previous speakers who said he wanted to express his disdain for the universities involved .,Democratic
we have universities here which are trying to express their disagreement with what they believe  and i agree  but what they believe to be an unfair prejudice that singles out some of their students .,Democratic
i understand disagreement with that  but disdain ?,Democratic
disdain because people in these positions feel that their students should not be unduly stigmatized and denied this opportunity ?,Democratic
if it is so important to have the opportunity  mr.,Democratic
speaker  should not people on the other side say  you can not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military .,Democratic
should you not say  you should not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military unless they are gay or lesbian .,Democratic
because if they are gay or lesbian  you want to deny them the opportunity to serve in the military regardless of any fault .,Democratic
remember  this is one that says we just stigmatize you from the outset .,Democratic
there is nothing you can do  there is no degree of service you can perform  there is no sacrifice you can offer to make that will allow you to serve your country .,Democratic
and then we will complain because we do not have enough people to serve in the military .,Democratic
and  again  literally thousands have been turned away .,Democratic
the universities are not blocking recruitment .,Democratic
they can not .,Democratic
they are asking for the right to stand up for principle .,Democratic
and now we are told by one other speaker  well  if they do not agree with the policy  you would think they would not accept the money .,Democratic
please .,Democratic
i would say to members  one rule in parliamentary debate : try to avoid saying something that no one will believe .,Democratic
i mean  this notion that if you do not agree with a policy you should boycott the government  which is using your tax money  nobody believes that .,Democratic
people get taxed  and sometimes they agree and sometimes they disagree .,Democratic
we say to people  look  you can voice your opinion  but you can not avoid paying the taxes .,Democratic
and  by the way  it is not money from the military they are seeking .,Democratic
typically  what we have here are law schools .,Democratic
it is law schools  as people have noted  who are doing this .,Democratic
so people have said  well  what about the poor people ?,Democratic
we are not getting enough wealthy people to offset the number of poor people .,Democratic
well  we are talking about lawyers who are being recruited .,Democratic
frankly  the poor people are not being recruited for the judge advocate general 's office .,Democratic
it just does not compute .,Democratic
but what they are saying is  we are not going to allow our facilities to be used in this discriminatory way .,Democratic
and the law schools  by the way  are not themselves  and this is an important point  under the clinton administration the ruling was that we would look at each element of a university separately .,Democratic
and if the law school said no military recruiting  that did not stop the medical school or the school of engineering from applying for federal funds .,Democratic
what you now have is a policy that says if the law school says no  no other entity can get the money .,Democratic
so there is no connection there .,Democratic
the key issue here is this : have we not in this country come to the point where patriotic young gay men and lesbians who are prepared to serve their country will at least be given a chance ?,Democratic
can you not judge them on their merits ?,Democratic
can you not say  okay  we admire your willingness to do this .,Democratic
we will judge you .,Democratic
if it turns out you become disruptive  we will act .,Democratic
but this blanket denial of even the opportunity no matter how talented  no matter how diligent ?,Democratic
you enforce that as a policy  and then you complain that we have people being turned away ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i hope this resolution is not adopted  and i hope we will begin to reverse this blanket prejudicial policy that says to millions  millions of young american men and women  you need not apply to defend your country because we do not like some aspect about you  even if it is going to be entirely irrelevant to your service .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank my colleague very much for the time .,Democratic
there certainly is no lack of understanding and appreciation for the united states military  particularly in the backdrop of free elections in iraq this past sunday .,Democratic
so  mr.,Democratic
speaker  this is not a debate  if you will  about the value of the military or  in fact  the necessity of giving them a far reach in their recruitment efforts in america .,Democratic
far be it from me  coming from the state of texas  that might be one of the states that has sent the largest numbers of its sons and daughters to the iraq war and afghanistan .,Democratic
having just sent 3  000 national guard and reservists troops about a month ago from their families over to iraq and afghanistan  we know full well the importance of the military but  more importantly  the sacrifice that our men and women make in the united states in serving in the military .,Democratic
i also am reminded that  until president truman integrated the armed forces  african americans were told  do not ask and do not apply .,Democratic
so this is not a question of whether or not we allow these individuals to accept federal funds .,Democratic
i would take issue with my colleague to suggest just do not take federal funds if they are not interested .,Democratic
i am disappointed that this is a closed rule  because there are important issues here  and the issues are that universities should not be forced to compromise their nondiscrimination policies .,Democratic
the military has been set aside as one of the most uniquely integrated and nondiscriminatory sections of our government .,Democratic
just because we have do not ask and do not tell does not mean that it is right  and if congress is really concerned about losing the best and the brightest  it should stop  if you will  discriminating against those because of their sexual orientation for any other reason .,Democratic
i am disappointed that in 2005 it was reported that between 1998 and 2004 the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi language speakers under the do-not-ask-and-do-not-tell policy .,Democratic
it is not without great admiration for our late colleague  congressman solomon  that i rise to just ask my colleagues  why do we close a rule when we can make this a better legislative initiative ?,Democratic
we needed to give the opportunity for the full discussion on discrimination .,Democratic
do my colleagues believe that americans would rise in support of discrimination ?,Democratic
do my colleagues realize that when we debated the 9/11 tragedy it was a gay american on one of our airplanes that engaged with others to be able to detour that airplane from the very site that i stand  to be able to save lives and to save the capitol of the united states of america ?,Democratic
it seems in 2005  in the shadow of reauthorization of the voters rights act of 1965  that we might not now recognize that we can do better .,Democratic
i am glad that rotc programs are still on our campuses .,Democratic
in fact  we know that there are more than 52  000 now enrolled in rotc programs  up from 48  000 in 2000 .,Democratic
that means 52  000 of our students .,Democratic
this past year 70 percent of the army 's newly commissioned armies came from rotc .,Democratic
in fact  the defense department has reported meeting all of its recruitment and retention goals in the past several years and is  in fact  actively downsizing certain specialties .,Democratic
but  in the backdrop of that  we also know that we need more troops  particularly if we are going to be part of a peacekeeping effort  not a running-the-government effort in iraq .,Democratic
so i would say  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the reason why i rise with great concerns about a closed rule and ask my colleagues to consider where we are going with this solomon amendment is that we can do better and that there is some merit  great merit  to asking the military to recruit everywhere and to allow universities of free thought to be able to maintain their nondiscriminatory rules and regulations .,Democratic
we can do better together  and i do not know why we discriminate against any american who wants to serve their country .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of our armed forces and in support of this nation 's continued efforts to give it the additional strength and stability it needs to keep our men and women safe .,Democratic
the members of this house have joined their constituents in mourning the loss of life and injuries sustained in the course of america 's war and subsequent occupation of iraq for two years .,Democratic
since the beginning of the iraq war in march 2003  1  423 members of the u.s. military have died  which includes 1  084 as a result of hostile action and 333 of non-hostile causes .,Democratic
furthermore  my district of houston has experienced two deaths already since january ; six deaths in 2004 ; five in 2003 ; and numerous injuries over the course of the nation 's engagement .,Democratic
no doubt  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i fully support the armed services .,Democratic
in the spirit of achieving the goal of attracting the best and brightest candidates for service  i join my colleague from california in advocating this legislation .,Democratic
however  we must support our troops in accordance with the u.s. constitution and with respect for civil rights and fundamental freedoms that are the rubric of this nation .,Democratic
when the house debated h.r.,Democratic
3966  which would allow for the denial of federal funds for educational institutions unless military recruiters are provided access to the campuses of these institutions  i voted `` yes '' on passage of the measure with the understanding that no constitutional contravention would result from its implementation .,Democratic
the resolution that is before the house today  however  is controversial because the final disposition of underlying federal jurisprudence could play a major role clarifying the way we apply constitutional principles to an act of congress .,Democratic
the holding in forum for academic and institutional rights v. rumsfeld tells us that we must be very careful in the way we regulate society so as not to violate fundamental rights .,Democratic
( 390 f.3d 219 ( 3rd cir .,Democratic
2004 ) ) .,Democratic
so  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i do support the intent of this legislation because i honor the men and women who serve in our armed services and who sacrifice their lives for us .,Democratic
however  i also support the upholding of the united states constitution and the respect for jurisprudence  and i believe it seriously damages our commitment to the three branches of government to encourage the interference with judicial decisions before a final rendering of a final review by the u.s. supreme court .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today in opposition to this resolution .,Democratic
in wisconsin  our state laws provide protections from discrimination to people that go beyond what many other states and what the federal government have put into law .,Democratic
such protections as nondiscrimination based on age  gender  marital status  membership in the national guard and sexual orientation are a part of wisconsin 's nondiscrimination laws .,Democratic
wisconsin has chosen to provide its citizens with these greater protections because we have decided that these are in the best interests of our citizens and are good public policy .,Democratic
the university of wisconsin in madison has a history as a leader in social justice .,Democratic
it adheres to state laws and has tried to apply those laws appropriately across its campus .,Democratic
that has included the requirement that campus organizations  departments and campus recruiters adhere to state law .,Democratic
yet federal law has intervened to block enforcement of campus policy and state law in regard to military recruiters .,Democratic
the solomon amendment was passed by a previous congress because students  like those at the university of wisconsin  were having success in blocking recruiters from campus if they discriminate against lesbians or gays or bisexuals in violation of state law and campus policy .,Democratic
access to and use of campus facilities to recruit students for higher educational opportunities  employment or military service should be at the discretion of the institution .,Democratic
of course  public institutions should not arbitrarily discriminate against any particular recruiter .,Democratic
reasonable and legitimate criteria should be evenly applied to every recruiter .,Democratic
the federal government should not use federal funding as a weapon to force noncompliance with state law or to create special rights for military recruiters .,Democratic
i believe that the court made the correct decision in invalidating the solomon amendment .,Democratic
i also believe that today 's resolution is unnecessary .,Democratic
in fact  i believe that today 's debate is the wrong debate .,Democratic
we should be looking at ways to strengthen our military and expand our resources for winning the fight against al qaeda and other terrorist organizations .,Democratic
mr. speaker  when will we have the debate about the harm caused by excluding so many qualified  skilled americans from serving in our military simply because they are gay or lesbian ?,Democratic
when will we have a debate about the waste of resources used to discharge fully trained personnel who are serving our country honorably ?,Democratic
when will we have the debate about how much our fight against terrorism is hurt by the discharges of arab linguists ?,Democratic
the resolution before us today makes vague reference to the costs to the military in having to arrange alternative recruitment strategies to meet its goals  but it does not mention the significant cost of do n't ask  do n't tell to our defense budget and to our national security .,Democratic
since do n't ask  do n't tell took effect in 1993  approximately 10  000 military personnel have been discharged .,Democratic
that is a huge amount of training and experience that we have lost .,Democratic
in a study of discharges between 1998 and 2003  university of santa barbara researchers found that  of 6  273 discharges  many were in critical specialties such as 88 linguists  including many arabic speakers  49 wmd experts  90 nuclear power engineers  and 150 rocket and missile specialists .,Democratic
to compensate for some of these discharges  the pentagon has been calling up members of the individual ready reserve .,Democratic
the harm to our military readiness and the cost to our security caused by do n't ask  do n't tell is clear .,Democratic
urging the administration to try to reinstate the solomon amendment will in no way make our country safer .,Democratic
let there be no mistake .,Democratic
i strongly support our men and women in uniform .,Democratic
i want to take this opportunity to honor the men and women in our armed forces who have served and continue to serve in iraq and to the many serving our country here and around the world .,Democratic
their efforts allowed the iraqi people to vote in a free election this week .,Democratic
their bravery and dedication is something all americans should admire and honor .,Democratic
mr. speaker  there would be no clamor for a solomon amendment if we simply allowed all qualified americans to serve their country in uniform .,Democratic
our country would be safer  our human resources would be greater  our country would be stronger if we treated all americans equally  regardless of their sexual orientation .,Democratic
it is time to repeal do n't ask  do n't tell .,Democratic
it will make our military stronger and our country stronger .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i want to thank the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr.,Democratic
cole ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes .,Democratic
i also want to welcome him as a new member of the committee on rules .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  here we are at the start of a new year and a new congress and we are considering this bill  surprise  surprise  under a closed rule .,Democratic
once again  the republican majority has decided that thoughtful debate and the ability for members to offer amendments if they so wish is unimportant or simply too much bother .,Democratic
the underlying bill  house concurrent resolution 36  was introduced yesterday  has not gone to committee  let alone and be reported out of committee  and was being taken up in the committee on rules yesterday just about the time that most members ' planes were touching down in washington .,Democratic
so once again the majority has followed its usual practice to stifle debate  prevent amendments  and ignore normal procedure to push a bill to the house floor ahead of more important issues facing the country .,Democratic
apparently  the republican leadership could not possibly start the new year out by deciding to finally help the more than one million jobless workers who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits without receiving additional aid .,Democratic
i know the majority does not like to be reminded that we still have the largest number of exhaustees in over 3 decades  but the 109th congress begins still facing this bitter reality and obviously still doing nothing to ease the hardships facing these workers and their families .,Democratic
clearly  the republican majority did not feel it necessary to press the president to get his supplemental request to assist the victims in nations affected by the asian tsunami quickly before the house  so we are not taking that measure up this week .,Democratic
in fact  we are not likely to act on this most urgent matter until march .,Democratic
but a bill exhorting the white house to ignore and overturn proceedings in the federal courts and to press higher education institutions to ignore their own policies prohibiting discrimination  well  that is a bill that gets top billing in the house of representatives today .,Democratic
mr. speaker  in the united states of america discrimination is wrong .,Democratic
period .,Democratic
but here we are right out of the gate with a bill that condones it .,Democratic
let us start with a little history on this bill .,Democratic
in the mid-90s  congress passed legislation to deny defense department funding to colleges and universities that fail to give military recruiters access to their campuses and students .,Democratic
known as the solomon law  that legislation was passed to respond to efforts by several colleges and universities to protest the discriminatory policies of the pentagon against gay men and women .,Democratic
over time  the law was expanded to prohibit funding a university might receive from nearly every federal agency  including the department of health and human services  the department of homeland security  the department of transportation  and the department of labor .,Democratic
last year this house passed a bill that would have expanded that list to include the cia and the national nuclear security administration of the department of energy .,Democratic
mr. speaker  there is an irony here .,Democratic
the congress is holding hostage funds from all of these other federal agencies to prop up discrimination by the pentagon .,Democratic
yet every one of these other federal agencies has full access to recruitment on college campuses .,Democratic
why ?,Democratic
because unlike the department of defense  no other federal agencies have policies that encourage discrimination against gay men and women .,Democratic
all of them have employees on their pay rolls .,Democratic
all of these federal agencies and the u.s. government and the american people benefit from the research and development programs that take place on these campuses  some of it carried out  no doubt  by gay men and women .,Democratic
so  mr.,Democratic
speaker  where does the solomon law stand today ?,Democratic
in november 2003  a u.s. district court in new jersey upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law  but it also determined that the solomon law does not give the pentagon any basis for asserting  as it has in regulations on implementing the solomon law  that universities and colleges must give military recruiters the same degree of access to campuses and students provided to other employers .,Democratic
in november 2004  just this past november  the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit overruled part of the new jersey district court 's ruling and found the solomon law to be in violation of the constitution .,Democratic
in an appeal brought by a number of schools  mainly graduate schools of law  the court ruled that colleges and universities had a first amendment right to exclude recruiters whose hiring practices discriminated against homosexuals .,Democratic
the u.s. department of justice now plans to appeal the case to the u.s. supreme court  and it has asked the appeals court to hold off enforcing the nullification of the solomon law until the supreme court decides on whether to take up the case or not .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me point out another irony in this debate today .,Democratic
there is absolutely no lack of equal access for military recruiters and rotc programs on america 's college campuses .,Democratic
what the pentagon receives is special access  pure and simple .,Democratic
to this day  any other employer  public or private  that fails to meet a school 's nondiscrimination policies is banned from employee recruitment on campuses .,Democratic
so the pentagon receives special access to our colleges and universities .,Democratic
the solomon law is about giving the military a special right to discriminate in a way other employers may not .,Democratic
this sense of congress resolution once again reinforces and promotes the pentagon 's discriminatory policy and practices to the detriment of all other education institutions and federal agencies .,Democratic
it further encourages the federal government in its pursuit to challenge court rulings that have upheld the first amendment rights of our colleges and universities in their efforts to end prejudice and discrimination .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the final irony of this debate you will hear today are the arguments about the need of the military to recruit the best and brightest students that america has to offer .,Democratic
i agree with this need  and the way to get there is for the pentagon to end its policy of discrimination .,Democratic
this would end the conflict between the pentagon and college policies against discrimination and prejudice .,Democratic
the pentagon has kicked out over 26 military linguists who were fluent in arabic or farsi simply because they were homosexual .,Democratic
that is unconscionable while our military men and women are facing a deadly insurgency in iraq and continued violence in afghanistan .,Democratic
in the past 5 years  in the army alone  over 3  000 uniformed servicemen and women have been discharged solely because of their sexual orientation .,Democratic
they were munitions experts  linguists  health care workers  infantrymen  tank mechanics  radio operators and active in every field of military endeavor .,Democratic
make no mistake about it  right now gay men and women are in battle in iraq and afghanistan  and they have likely died in combat in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
they serve their nation just as they have since the founding of the united states  bravely  patriotically and devotedly  but their superiors do not commend their service .,Democratic
if their sexual orientation is discovered  they are drummed out .,Democratic
mr. speaker  there is no lack of access to for the military on america 's campuses .,Democratic
every university that wants an rotc program has one .,Democratic
according to the wall street journal  more than 52  000 college students are enrolled in rotc programs  up from 48  000 in 2000 .,Democratic
many credit feelings of patriotism engendered by the september 11 attacks  and it comes as no surprise that military enlistment by college graduates has also increased since the events of september 11 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we do not need the solomon law .,Democratic
we do not need the bill before us today  and we certainly do not need to continue to insult and assault those very institutions of higher education that are leading the way to end hate and discrimination in america .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am wondering  based on that argument  in the interest of efficiency  whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor of the house  and if being on the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out .,Democratic
maybe if we had chat rooms or instant messaging  we could probably save a lot more .,Democratic
i would urge the majority  since this traditional kind of old-fashioned type of democracy does not seem to have much appeal  to go right ahead  might even save a little more money  by cutting back on what thomas jefferson or abe lincoln or one of those people might have thought was an appropriate way to conduct the business of democracy .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for his succinct observation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  before i yield to the gentlewoman from texas  i just want to respond to my colleague from oklahoma .,Democratic
he mentioned that this resolution has been posted on the web site for 3 days or 4 days .,Democratic
i should say to him that that is not a substitute for the committee process .,Democratic
that is why we have committees .,Democratic
secondly  i am glad that the gentleman believes that the bill needs no amendment  but there are 434 other members of this house that should have the opportunity to amend this bill  if they so desire .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i appreciate the gentleman 's comments .,Democratic
i know that the gentleman does not approach this in any other fashion but a bipartisan fashion .,Democratic
but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year  it could be that five members on our side of the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize .,Democratic
there could be five individuals on the republican side of the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize .,Democratic
that is 10 people  10 bills  10 instances where members have garnered two-thirds .,Democratic
who then will decide who gets the medals ?,Democratic
it then becomes a very political decision as to who gets each of the medals .,Democratic
will it be the five on the majority side ?,Democratic
will it be two from the majority side ?,Democratic
will it be two from the minority side ?,Democratic
will it be one each ?,Democratic
who of the 10 deserving will get it  and who will not get it ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
frank ) xz4001400 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume in closing .,Democratic
this congress should be leading the way to end discrimination of any form in this country .,Democratic
unfortunately  we have a resolution before us today that condones discrimination .,Democratic
i think it is sad we are dealing with this today .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the resolution .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  first i thank the gentleman from north carolina ( mr.,Democratic
butterfield ) xz4006160 for yielding me this time to speak  time to speak in opposition to h. con .,Democratic
res.,Democratic
36 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  last november a federal court said the federal government can not take away a university 's funding simply because the school refuses to exempt the u.s. military from its policy  meaning the university 's policy  and that on-campus recruiters not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .,Democratic
today we are debating a resolution in support of the solomon amendment .,Democratic
if this house of representatives votes to support that resolution  we will be putting the congress on record as supporting absolute senseless discrimination .,Democratic
the resolution says it is about equal access for military recruiters at institutions of higher education .,Democratic
but  in reality  it is about allowing the military to avoid the consequences of discrimination  the same consequences that any other employer would have to face if it discriminated .,Democratic
many say  and you heard it today  that our national security requires the military to engage in this discrimination  but the facts just do not support it .,Democratic
the court said that the government failed to produce  and i quote  `` a shred of evidence '' that the solomon amendment helps military recruiting  and even suggested that the hostility that the amendment causes may hurt recruiting .,Democratic
it was reported in last month that since 1998  the military has discharged 20 fluent arabic speakers and six fluent farsi speakers under its `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy .,Democratic
these are students that the military claims to be desperate to recruit .,Democratic
no  mr.,Democratic
speaker  this resolution is not about military recruiting or national security .,Democratic
plain and simple  it is about punishing universities for exercising their first amendment right to oppose discrimination against gays and lesbians ; and i encourage my colleagues  stand up for the constitution  oppose this resolution .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this resolution would have us believe that a grave threat is presented to the security of this nation by the policy of some institutions of higher learning to bar military recruiters from their campus because of the discrimination against gay and lesbian people by the military .,Democratic
but that  mr.,Democratic
speaker  is not the threat to our national security .,Democratic
the threat to our national security is the policy of the military to refuse to use the talents and the abilities of gay people in defending our country .,Democratic
one of the biggest problems we have in iraq now is the shortage of people who know how to translate intelligence documents written in arabic and farsi  and yet they are dismissing linguists who can translate these documents for our use to save the lives of our troops because they are gay .,Democratic
this is insanity .,Democratic
our troops are paying with their lives because of the bigotry that this congress has mandated on the military  number one .,Democratic
even that is not the real issue presented by this resolution .,Democratic
the real issue presented by this resolution has to do with free speech and association .,Democratic
private universities  private institutions have chosen to say  as part of their free speech  that they do not want on their campus recruiters from any organization  the military  any private company  anybody else  that discriminates against gay people and lesbian people ; that engages in an unacceptable  to them  form of discrimination .,Democratic
it is not a question  as this resolution says  of equal access to military recruiters .,Democratic
all people  recruiters from all institutions that discriminate are barred from these campuses .,Democratic
we should not have passed the bill that we did  but we passed a bill to say that  if they do that  if a private institution bars military recruiters and other recruiters on an equal basis  we will withhold federal funds .,Democratic
the third circuit court of appeals says that is a violation of the first amendment .,Democratic
this resolution says who cares what the courts say .,Democratic
we do not care about the first amendment .,Democratic
we do not care about the courts .,Democratic
we know better .,Democratic
we encourage the executive branch to follow the doctrine of non-acquiescence and not find a decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on another jurisdiction .,Democratic
that is not the way we ought to legislate .,Democratic
this decision was decided by the third circuit court of appeals .,Democratic
the executive branch is going to appeal to the united states supreme court .,Democratic
let it appeal .,Democratic
let us see what the supreme court says  if they accept the case .,Democratic
the courts have to defend our liberties .,Democratic
it is the province of the courts  not of the congress  to declare what the constitution means .,Democratic
our liberties  the bill of rights  are protected from the majority .,Democratic
you never have to protect the majority from itself .,Democratic
you have to protect unpopular minorities .,Democratic
that is why we have a bill of rights and that is why we have the courts to enforce them .,Democratic
for congress to come in and say the court is wrong and the executive should not enforce the order of the court is to show a disdain for the rule of law and a disdain for the spirit of liberty for which we are fighting in iraq and for which our armed forces exists in the first place .,Democratic
this resolution ought to be defeated on its merits .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from wisconsin ( ms.,Democratic
baldwin ) xz4000130 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
farr ) xz4001290 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i do not accept the suggestion that the academic community is un-american and not in support of our military .,Democratic
my friends in the academic community  and i have many in north carolina who are part of the academic community  they are good americans and they support our military completely .,Democratic
i sincerely believe that these individuals have a genuine difference of legal opinion that must be resolved by our supreme court  and that is why i am supporting this resolution .,Democratic
we need a determination by our supreme court of this matter .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
if the gentleman would yield  i appreciate my good friend 's good suggestion  and i am prepared to begin yielding time to colleagues who are present to begin speaking .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
woolsey ) xz4004360 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from new york .,Democratic
it boggles my mind that the united states provides any funding to the saudi kingdom .,Democratic
with all of its oil and all of its wealth  it is nothing short of insanity .,Democratic
it is no secret  in spite of what the last speaker said  that the saudi regime is a leading exporter of terrorism worldwide ; it is a leading financier of terrorism worldwide .,Democratic
the thought that one cent of american money is being spent in saudi arabia is an insult to every american taxpayer .,Democratic
the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressive-thinking nation and they are our partners in the global war on terrorism .,Democratic
that is what their pr firm says  anyway .,Democratic
nothing could be further from the truth .,Democratic
this is our partner in peace ?,Democratic
fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals .,Democratic
that did not happen by accident .,Democratic
this is the same saudi arabia that has the worst record for religious tolerance on the planet  the same saudi arabia that exudes racism and anti-semitic hatred .,Democratic
our partners in peace ?,Democratic
how shameful for the united states .,Democratic
the saudis claim that they are prosecuting terrorists .,Democratic
who are they kidding ?,Democratic
saudi efforts to prosecute terrorists are inept at best and more accurately nonexistent .,Democratic
if they are doing anything in lebanon  it is for themselves  not for the people of the united states of america .,Democratic
i ask everyone to support the weiner amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank very much my friend from florida for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  my opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 is for two reasons  one that is broader in the context of the problems we face  and one is specific to asylum .,Democratic
i am just going to address the former on the issue of debating essentially an unobjectionable rule that simply allows for general debate and urge opposition on that ground alone .,Democratic
the placement of the bill on this agenda at this particular time is a manifestation of the triumph of ideology over common sense  and it is a response to spasms of anger rather than a reflection of sober analysis .,Democratic
contrary to the arguments of the republicans  including my friend  the chairman of the committee  including the majority leader of this house  the issues of immigration reform  border security  national security  and public safety are inextricably linked .,Democratic
but we hear not one word or hint of any intention on the part of the majority in this house  in contrast with both the president and the leadership in the senate  of ever dealing with the fundamental issue .,Democratic
our immigration system is broken .,Democratic
the results of that breakdown endanger american security .,Democratic
between 8 and 14 million people are in this country without legal status .,Democratic
they live in our shadows .,Democratic
they utilize false documents .,Democratic
their true identity is unknown .,Democratic
for the most part  they work and pay taxes .,Democratic
and  except for their illegal status  they observe our laws .,Democratic
they provide the overwhelming proportion of the workforce in critical industries .,Democratic
they are located throughout the country and they are subject to all kinds of exploitation  but for a variety of reasons  they have no intention of leaving this country .,Democratic
a few among them  without doubt  a few among them mean harm to americans and are plotting terrorist acts .,Democratic
the status quo is simply intolerable .,Democratic
but where the proponents of this bill are so wrong  so self-defeating  is in thinking that piecemeal fixes like this have anything to do with protecting americans against those who are plotting to harm us .,Democratic
only a comprehensive approach that deals with issues like defense  like a nonforgeable identifier  a nonforgeable social security card  effective enforcement  and coming to terms with the status of the 8 to 14 million people who are working and linked to working and have committed no other crimes  getting them out of the shadows so we can know who they are  we can fingerprint them and match them to watch lists .,Democratic
that is the only way to deal with the problem .,Democratic
look at our situation .,Democratic
the majority leader says `` this bill is a border security bill .,Democratic
it is a homeland security bill .,Democratic
immigration reform is a completely different subject.,Democratic
'' the chairman of our committee  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650  says `` it is to everybody 's best interest to separate out the security questions from the immigration questions.,Democratic
'' but you can not .,Democratic
president bush knows that .,Democratic
he realizes that these gentlemen are wrong  that this analysis is wrong  that this piecemeal approach is not going to do the job ; and he has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform of our immigration system because `` the current system results in diverting homeland security resources to chasing people who are here because they want to put food on their table .,Democratic
they take resources away from catching criminals and terrorists.,Democratic
'' that is the president .,Democratic
senator cornyn  the new chairman of the subcommittee on immigration and claims  no liberal he  realizes that the strategy of the gentleman from wisconsin is a mistake .,Democratic
he said it pretty specifically  `` i do n't believe we can deal with border security and homeland security without dealing with immigration reform.,Democratic
'' aside from the asylum provisions  i do not have any heartburn about these  of course  in a world where we have fixed the system so it does not have 8 to 14 million people here out of status  illegally  undocumented  and people who should not get driver 's licenses .,Democratic
but this will not solve the problem .,Democratic
there will be people who are not going to be here legally  who will have driver 's licenses after this bill passes  and there will be people with false ids after this bill passes ; and you will not have dealt with the fundamental issue .,Democratic
for that reason  more than any other  although the fundamental change of the asylum system that is going to keep people fleeing persecution from finding their historic asylum in this country  without dealing anything with terrorists who are already eligible for asylum  is another reason to oppose this bill  and i urge opposition on it .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from massachusetts .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i insert in the record at this point two articles .,Democratic
one is an editorial from the new york times entitled  `` the price of homophobia.,Democratic
'' another is an associate press story entitled  `` report : number of gay linguists discharged higher than thought.,Democratic
'' the price of homophobia do n't ask  do n't tell -- just scream in frustration : it turns out that 20 of the arabic speakers so vitally needed by the nation have been thrown out of the military since 1998 because they were found to be gay .,Democratic
it is hard to imagine a more wrongheaded rebuff of national priorities .,Democratic
the focus must be on the search for osama bin laden and his terrorist legions  not the closet door .,Democratic
the pentagon 's snooping after potential gays trumps what every investigative agency in the war on terror has admitted is a crucial shortage of effective arabic translators .,Democratic
after the first world trade center attack  in 1993  government agents revealed an alarming shortage of arabic speakers .,Democratic
key notes  videotapes and a phone call pertaining to the attack were later found in a backlog of untranslated investigative data .,Democratic
the shortage continued right up to and well beyond the 9/11 attacks .,Democratic
three years after the towers were destroyed  the f.b.i.  rife with translation problems  admitted it had an untranslated backlog of 120  000 hours of intercepts with potential value about looming threats .,Democratic
at the state department  a study showed that only one in five of the 279 arabic translators were fluent enough to handle the subtleties of the language  with its many regional dialects .,Democratic
the military 's experience is no more encouraging  with intelligence results muddied at times by a rush  as one inquiry put it  to recruit arab convenience store owners and cabdrivers  who could n't handle the task .,Democratic
the military is right to rely more on its language schools  but it can take several years to produce fluent graduates .,Democratic
the folly of using `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy against such precious national resources amounts to comfort for the enemy .,Democratic
when president bush was asked last week by the washington post why osama bin laden had eluded capture  he replied  `` because he 's hiding.,Democratic
'' so is the pentagon -- it 's hiding from reality .,Democratic
report : number of gay linguists discharged higher than thought san francisco ( ap ) -- the number of arabic linguists discharged from the military for violating its `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy was nearly three times as high as previously reported  according to records obtained by an advocacy group .,Democratic
between 1998 and 2004  the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi speakers  according to department of defense data obtained by the center for the study of sexual minorities in the military under a freedom of information act request .,Democratic
the military previously confirmed that seven translators who specialized in arabic had been discharged because they were gay .,Democratic
the updated numbers were first reported by the new republic magazine .,Democratic
aaron belkin  the center 's director  said he wants the public to see the real costs of `` do n't ask  do n't tell.,Democratic
'' `` we had a language problem after 9/11 and we still have a language problem  '' belkin said wednesday .,Democratic
the military 's `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they keep their sexual orientation private and do not engage in homosexual acts .,Democratic
but belkin and other advocates say such a policy endangers national security at a time u.s. intelligence agencies and the military say they do n't have enough arabic speakers .,Democratic
`` the military is placing homophobia ahead of national security  '' said steve ralls  spokesman for the servicemembers legal defense network  a nonprofit group which advocates for the rights of gay military members .,Democratic
`` it 's appalling that in the weeks leading up to 9/11 messages were coming in waiting to be translated ... ..,Democratic
and at the same time they were firing people who could 've done that job.,Democratic
'' but others  like elaine donnelly of the center for military readiness  a conservative advocacy group that opposes gays serving in the military  said the discharged linguists never should have been accepted at the elite defense language institute in monterey in the first place .,Democratic
`` resources unfortunately were used to train young people who were not eligible to be in the military  '' she said .,Democratic
`` we need to recruit people who are eligible to serve.,Democratic
'' in the fiscal year ended oct .,Democratic
31  2004  543 arabic linguists and 166 farsi linguists graduated from their 63-week courses  according to a dli spokesman .,Democratic
that was up from 377 and 139  respectively  in the previous year  reflecting the military 's increased need for translators in iraq .,Democratic
experts have identified the shortage of arabic linguists as contributing to the government 's failure to predict the sept .,Democratic
11 attacks .,Democratic
the independent sept .,Democratic
11 commission made similar conclusions .,Democratic
the government `` lacked sufficient translators proficient in arabic and other key languages '' to adequately prepare itself against future strikes  the report said .,Democratic
`` it used to be this was seen as a gay rights issue  but now it 's clearly a national security issue  '' said nathaniel frank  a senior research fellow at the center for study of sexual minorities in the military at the university of california  santa barbara .,Democratic
ian finkenbinder  a u.s. army arabic linguist who graduated from the defense language institute in 2002  was discharged from the military last month after announcing to his superiors that he 's gay .,Democratic
finkenbinder  who said his close friends in the army already knew he was gay  served eight months in iraq and was about to return for a second tour when he made the revelation official .,Democratic
`` i looked at myself and said  `are you willing to go to war with an institution that wo n't recognize that you have the right to live as you want to  ' `` said finkenbinder  22  who now lives in baltimore  md .,Democratic
`` it just got to be tiresome to deal with that -- to constantly have such a significant part of your life under scrutiny.,Democratic
'' finkenbinder said his commander was upset to let him go because his arabic proficiency was at the highest possible for a nonnative speaker .,Democratic
the servicemembers legal defense network last month sued the government on behalf of 12 gay former military members seeking reinstatement .,Democratic
they 're seeking to overturn `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' alleging it violates their constitutional rights .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield to nobody my concern that this bill has regarding the environment  but that is not the point .,Democratic
we have already had our colleague  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
duncan )  talk about how we passed specific legislation signed by president clinton that suspended the endangered species act .,Democratic
what we are talking about here is far beyond this .,Democratic
it is talking about suspending all laws  health  safety  immigration  payment for private property .,Democratic
all laws  not the environment .,Democratic
my colleagues would be creating not a couple of miles of exception to finish a fence  but you would be creating a zone 7  514 miles long under the terms of this bill  5  500 in canada  almost 2  000 with the border of mexico  where all laws are suspended in the vicinity of the barrier .,Democratic
my colleagues have no idea how much land they are exempting from compensation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  there are only 11  751 people who have been privileged to serve in this chamber .,Democratic
i do not think any of them have ever been asked to vote on anything more irresponsible .,Democratic
it is a terrible precedent  unnecessary  and i urge its defeat .,Democratic
mr. chairman  today 's bill would not be nearly as flawed or controversial if it had the benefit of going through the committee process .,Democratic
unfortunately  we are faced with costly legislation that overturns states rights and does little to address the problems of our immigration system or to protect americans from another terrorist attack .,Democratic
instead  this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens on state governments and makes department of motor vehicles ( dmv ) employees de facto immigration officers .,Democratic
this policy promises to be ineffective as there are approximately 70 different kinds of immigration related documents issued by the federal government .,Democratic
this bill will not deter illegal immigration ; it will probably mean illegal immigrants will drive without licenses .,Democratic
in addition  in order to complete three miles of a border fence near san diego  section 102 of this bill suspends all laws  from public health and labor to the environment and property compensation .,Democratic
in fact  all barriers and roads along 7  514 miles of u.s. borders would be exempt from all laws .,Democratic
one person in the department of homeland security would be above the law without any judicial appeal or remedy .,Democratic
this is unprecedented .,Democratic
some of the environmental laws waived would include the noise control act  the clean water act  the farmland protection policy act  and the bald eagle act .,Democratic
in addition to being bad public policy  this exemption is unnecessary  as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them .,Democratic
this legislation will not make us safer or reduce illegal immigration .,Democratic
in the end  it is hard to imagine a more dangerous precedent .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
i am troubled by the amendment that we have before us today .,Democratic
there is  i think  a wide range of opinion that is available for us to debate the merits of a wide range of things in this bill .,Democratic
and i appreciate that people are coming forward in good spirit .,Democratic
but i appreciate the comment of the gentleman from arizona .,Democratic
it was  i want to say  i do not want to say it was my privilege  but i had the opportunity to spend time after the tsunami a couple of weeks after it hit with a bipartisan delegation led by the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360  senator brownback  touring the area .,Democratic
i assure you that the testimony about the devastation is  if anything  understated .,Democratic
the pictures that we saw on cnn did not do justice .,Democratic
but i was struck by the impact of the generosity that was shown by americans in uniform  civilian employees  members of ngos who were there .,Democratic
there was some bad publicity initially  surrounding what appeared to be a lack of compassion on the part of the united states with its initial response .,Democratic
but that never interfered in terms of the publicity with the work that was done by the united states and our agencies .,Democratic
we built amazing goodwill for this country while we helped these traumatized areas heal .,Democratic
i think what has been offered by the president  by the committee  is the least that we can do .,Democratic
it will pay dividends many times over .,Democratic
i think that it would be unfortunate even to bring this proposal to a vote .,Democratic
it is sending the wrong signal about the united states ' intention .,Democratic
we are certainly  on a per capita basis  not giving more than australia  scandinavia  germany .,Democratic
for us to indicate that there is a sense here could only be interpreted as our being callous and unfeeling  i think  is the wrong message to send to these people in these traumatized countries .,Democratic
i think it is the wrong thing to send to the international community .,Democratic
i will say  mr.,Democratic
chairman  in the course of the visit  i had people who were americans in business  people from the ngo communities  foreign parliamentarians  all talking about the damaged relationship that the united states has  the image that we have in this region  and how amazing they felt the progress was being made by the work that was being done by our country .,Democratic
this amendment and any support for it  i think  is sending the wrong signal .,Democratic
and i strongly urge its rejection .,Democratic
i sincerely hope that it is rejected  if necessary  on a voice vote  if not withdrawn .,Democratic
but i hope people make no mistake about how people are watching our actions for the signals we send around the world .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reluctantly voted against this supplemental  not because there are n't many important items included in it  but because a `` no '' vote is one of the few things in my power to signal my deep opposition to the administration 's policy in iraq .,Democratic
at its core  this bill gives too much money to the wrong people to do the wrong thing .,Democratic
as i made clear from the beginning of this war the administration continues to have no plan for success in iraq .,Democratic
they have no blueprint for winning the peace and have not even adequately protected our troops in harm 's way .,Democratic
i fully support the assistance to the tsunami-affected region  and hope it will be used wisely for recovery  reconstruction  and mitigation of future disasters .,Democratic
while we can not prevent natural events such as floods  mudslides  volcanic eruptions  earthquakes  or tsunamis  we can reduce or mitigate their devastating impacts by helping communities to rebuild in safer locations  construct sturdier dwellings  and enhance natural ecosystems that mitigate the impact of these natural disasters .,Democratic
i am pleased to see that there is funding to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq .,Democratic
i hope that they will use the funding provided by congress to give our troops the protection that they need .,Democratic
an amendment that i offered with mr.,Democratic
markey to prohibit funds for torture and for sending detainees to countries that practice torture passed .,Democratic
the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible  puts americans at risk  is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism  and sets back the cause of democracy .,Democratic
this is the very least that we can do as congress continues to abdicate its responsibility to investigate this horrific aspect of administration policy .,Democratic
regardless of the merits  everyone should be troubled by the use of supplemental legislation to pay for regular military action in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
funding these operations outside of the regular budgeting process limits our ability for effective oversight and distorts the true budget picture .,Democratic
the rules committee burdened this legislation with all the flaws of h.r.,Democratic
418  the `` real id act  '' which  among other things  placed the entire 7  514 mile border completely outside all legal protections .,Democratic
this is perhaps the most damaging single precedent since i 've been in congress .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong opposition of this bill .,Democratic
it does nothing to make america safer .,Democratic
it is simply anti-immigrant legislation placed under the mask of homeland security .,Democratic
the bill will prevent states from giving licenses to undocumented immigrants .,Democratic
it will not prevent terrorists from obtaining identification forms .,Democratic
all of the 9/11 hijackers were in this country legally .,Democratic
in fact  allowing immigrants to have licenses actually improves homeland security by allowing our government to track who is in our borders .,Democratic
this bill will also raise insurmountable hurdles for refugees seeking asylum and will deport victims of persecution into the hands of their persecutors .,Democratic
proponents of this provision claim that we need to tighten asylum laws  yet  they can not pinpoint a single terrorist given asylum in the united states .,Democratic
this bill will also require the completion of a fence on the mexican border  waiving environmental laws in california .,Democratic
this fence is a complete waste of money and resources .,Democratic
people will go over it  under it and around it to enter our country .,Democratic
our immigration system is a broken system that needs to be fixed .,Democratic
we need reform that provides hardworking people of good character with a real path towards citizenship .,Democratic
but this bill is simply a band-aid on the problem that will not provide lasting reform .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i wish to discuss one critically important component of this bill  the $ 200 million in aid to the palestinians .,Democratic
the president has requested $ 350 million for the palestinians  and he asks that $ 200 million be included in today 's supplemental bill .,Democratic
the president believes  as do i  that it is imperative to deliver u.s. assistance quickly to improve palestinians ' quality of life and empower their democratically elected leadership .,Democratic
i am pleased this bill funds the palestinian assistance request .,Democratic
this money will be used on critical projects  such transportation infrastructure  drinking water  business and trade  education and democratic and legal reforms .,Democratic
mr. chairman  on january 9  i was privileged to witness the remarkable palestinian presidential election firsthand .,Democratic
i saw democracy taking hold in palestine .,Democratic
i saw the mandate being handed to president abbas .,Democratic
the palestinian people support their new president 's goals  to end the armed intifadah and to create a viable state living in peace alongside israel .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the arafat era is over .,Democratic
the new palestinian president and his government are making great strides .,Democratic
they are committed to political reform .,Democratic
their financial reform efforts  which are led by minister salaam fayyad  have produced profound accountability and transparency .,Democratic
on the critical question of security  president abbas is also off to a good start .,Democratic
he has clearly and unequivocally condemned terrorism .,Democratic
with the exception of one horrific bombing in tel aviv  the cease-fire has held .,Democratic
the palestinian security forces have begun to fight terror and incitement .,Democratic
they have arrested terrorists for the first time in many years .,Democratic
yesterday  here on capitol hill  the ambassador of israel sat next to the palestinian ambassador and praised the palestinian authority for their security efforts .,Democratic
prime minister sharon has welcomed the palestinian moves as well .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the real question before us today is not whether to keep the $ 200 million for palestinian assistance in this bill .,Democratic
clearly  this package serves u.s. national interests and will enhance israel 's security and the quality of life for the palestinians .,Democratic
but the real question is whether the u.s. congress is serious about working with president bush  prime minister sharon  and president abbas to seize this historic opportunity .,Democratic
the excessive conditions and limitations placed on this package may undermine progress toward peace .,Democratic
of course  we must secure transparency and accountability ; but the requirements in this legislation go far beyond what we demanded in the arafat era .,Democratic
imagine that .,Democratic
president bush and prime minister sharon are helping to strengthen and empower president abbas  but at the same time congress will slap more conditions on them than they ever did on arafat .,Democratic
one especially troubling provision in the bill strikes the national security waiver under which the president could provide some of this aid directly to the palestinian authority .,Democratic
president bush has decided in the past that some u.s. aid be directed to the authority .,Democratic
this bill would prevent him from doing that  tying his hands at the very moment that he most needs flexibility to promote our interests in the middle east .,Democratic
my colleagues should understand this bill puts more restrictions on the president than we ever placed on president clinton .,Democratic
mr. chairman  there is a broad consensus in the american pro-israel community in support of the president 's aid request for the palestinians .,Democratic
the jewish council for public affairs  the umbrella group of 13 prominent national organizations and 122 local jewish communities  has recently urged congress to fund the palestinian request in its entirety .,Democratic
the union for reform judaism  representing 1.5 million american jews  believes the aid should go directly to the palestinian authority .,Democratic
americans for peace now wants us to support this package and remove the excessive conditions that the committee has placed on it .,Democratic
in asking us to support a clean aid package  m.j. rosenberg of the israel policy forum states the following : `` israel wants a strong palestinian authority that can and will liquidate the suicide bombers and build a democracy that will live in peace with israel.,Democratic
'' the arafat years are over .,Democratic
fragile as it may be  a new flame of hope and optimism has been kindled in the middle east .,Democratic
shame on us as americans if we do not do whatever we can to seize this historic opportunity .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to support the $ 200 million in palestinian assistance  i urge us to reject any amendments to strip this aid  and i hope in the conference with the senate that we can give back to the president the flexibility he needs to promote u.s. security interests in the region .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of h.r.,Democratic
1268  to authorize emergency supplemental appropriations for our military .,Democratic
the vast majority of this $ 82 billion bill will go directly to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
congress has a responsibility to work with the president to protect the national security of our nation .,Democratic
when our soldiers are sent in to war  it is the congress ' responsibility to make sure that all resources necessary are provided to carry out their missions .,Democratic
i stand behind our brave men and women who have performed admirably in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
they have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of their country and have served longer deployments than expected .,Democratic
this bill provides important new benefits for our troops and their families .,Democratic
the legislation : increases the military death gratuity ; increases subsidized life insurance benefits ; creates a new insurance benefit for soldiers who have suffered traumatic injuries  such as the loss of a limb ; extends the basic allowance for housing for dependents of soldiers who die while on active duty ; and provides additional funding for add-on vehicle armor kits  night-vision equipment  and radio jammers that disrupt remote-control bombs and mines .,Democratic
the conference report also contains important measures to strengthen our domestic border security  by providing funds for new border patrol agents  immigration and customs investigators  enforcement agents  and detention officers .,Democratic
the bill also provides additional foreign assistance for : tsunami reconstruction ; humanitarian and peacekeeping programs in darfur ; democracy assistance in belarus ; and political and economic reforms in ukraine to strengthen their new democracy and legal system .,Democratic
i regret that the administration has consistently failed to properly budget for our ongoing military and reconstruction operations in iraq .,Democratic
congress should not repeatedly rely on emergency spending bills to provide the critical funding  resources  and equipment for our troops in battle by using emergency supplemental appropriations bills .,Democratic
the united states is only belatedly seeking international support for our reconstruction efforts in iraq  and we have failed to broadly engage the international community .,Democratic
because of these failures  americans have paid a heavy price .,Democratic
it is primarily american troops stationed in iraq that face continuing attacks  and have lost life and limb .,Democratic
it is our taxpayers that are being asked to almost exclusively pay the cost to rebuild iraq  and these costs are mounting every day .,Democratic
iraq is already facing a difficult transition in establishing a democracy that operates under the rule of law and protects minority rights .,Democratic
the u.s. must show enough flexibility in working with our allies to effectively help iraq during this critical transition period  so that other countries will pledge both troops and funds to alleviate the burden on our american soldiers and taxpayers .,Democratic
ultimately  the best way that we can support our troops is to reach out more aggressively to the international community  establish order and security in iraq  and help the interim iraqi government assume more responsibility for its own affairs as they establish a democratic state .,Democratic
i am also disappointed that the republican leadership decided to insert extraneous provisions into this legislation  which go beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
i voted against the `` real id act '' when it was considered by this house as a separate bill earlier this year .,Democratic
i am particularly concerned that this legislation repeals a number of provisions of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004  which enacted the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
the 9/11 bill established a negotiated rulemaking framework -- allowing for critical input from governors  state legislators  state officials  and other stakeholders -- which would provide the opportunity to develop effective national standards for driver 's licenses .,Democratic
i am concerned that this legislation does not give the states adequate flexibility to implement the 9/11 bill  and that this legislation may also create serious unfunded mandates and administrative burdens for the states .,Democratic
as the ranking member of the helsinki commission ( commission on security and cooperation in europe )  which promotes human rights and rule of law in europe  i am also concerned about many of the asylum law changes contained in the real id act  which again go beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
these provisions may have a harmful effect on true asylum seekers  trafficking victims  women and children who are victims of domestic violence  and others seeking protection against persecution .,Democratic
this legislation may create higher burdens for legitimate asylum seekers  restrict judicial discretion to grant asylum  and take away some of the rights of appeal for certain refugees and asylum seekers .,Democratic
over the past week i have heard from a number of groups in maryland that provide legal and social services to immigrants  asylum seekers  refugees  and survivors of torture and slavery .,Democratic
these groups have reported to me that it is already extremely difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prevail in their case  as they have often left their home country on short notice  and do not have documentation of their persecution .,Democratic
it can take months or years for a case to work its way through our legal system .,Democratic
during this period  the asylum seeker often has neither legal representation nor work documentation .,Democratic
i hope that in the near future congress will have the opportunity  in a more thoughtful manner  to consider comprehensive immigration reform measures .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this appropriations bill contains much crucial funding  most importantly money to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq and electronic jammers to protect them from roadside bombs .,Democratic
while i strongly support this funding  i am disappointed that i must vote `` no '' on this bill .,Democratic
we have a responsibility to the men and women who we send into harm 's way as members of the united states armed forces .,Democratic
it is because of my desire to support our troops that i continue to insist that the administration develop a plan to win the peace in iraq and  to the best of our capability  protect the troops as they go about their mission .,Democratic
i believe that congress must hold the administration to the highest standards when the lives of our service personnel are at risk .,Democratic
a `` no '' vote is one of the few ways i have to protest the continued abdication of this responsibility by the highest levels of the bush administration .,Democratic
one positive part of this legislation is an amendment that i offered during house consideration with mr.,Democratic
markey to prohibit funds for torture and for sending detainees to countries that practice torture  which was carried into this conference report .,Democratic
the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible  puts americans at risk  is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism  and sets back the cause of democracy .,Democratic
this is the very least that we can do as congress continues to abdicate its responsibility to investigate this horrific aspect of administration policy .,Democratic
perhaps most disappointing  this legislation also continues to be burdened with all the flaws of h.r.,Democratic
418  the `` real id act  '' which  among other things  placed the entire 7  514 mile border completely outside all legal protections .,Democratic
this is perhaps the single most damaging precedent since i 've been in congress .,Democratic
do we really want to be giving this responsibility to the department of homeland security  which has not been a paragon of efficiency and sensitivity during its three years of existence ?,Democratic
some of the environmental laws waived by this provision include : the noise control act  the clean water act  the farmland protection policy act  and the bald eagle act .,Democratic
this is not only bad public policy  it is unnecessary  as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them .,Democratic
however  in addition to environmental laws  this provision would waive labor laws  safety standards  the national historic preservation act  and the native,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i appreciate the gentlewoman 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this  and i agree with her very strongly .,Democratic
make no mistake  our side of the aisle is supportive of this legislation .,Democratic
we want to work with the state and local authorities first to do it right .,Democratic
these are the people who feel these concerns every bit as strongly as members of congress .,Democratic
in fact  they are on the line every day providing for the safety and security of our constituents in a much more immediate sense than we are .,Democratic
do not be afraid to work with them .,Democratic
but with all due respect to the gentlewoman from the district of columbia  i have one other provision that deeply offends me as a former elected official  as a member of this body and somebody who believes in checks and balances .,Democratic
i look at section 102 .,Democratic
i wish that it were buried in the legislation  but it is not .,Democratic
it is right here in the beginning .,Democratic
if this provision  the waiver of all laws necessary for quote improvements of barriers at the border was to become law  the secretary of homeland security could give a contract to his political cronies that had no safety standards  using 12-year-old illegal immigrants to do the labor  run it through the site of a native american burial ground  kill bald eagles in the process  and pollute the drinking water of neighboring communities .,Democratic
and under the provisions of this act  no member of congress  no citizen could do anything about it because you waive all judicial review .,Democratic
now  bear in mind you are giving this authority to the head of homeland security  hardly a paragon of sensitivity and efficiency .,Democratic
anybody who stands in those lines week after week or watches the bizarre color-coded warning system knows that that is hardly the exemplar .,Democratic
security at the borders is important ; and if somebody has a problem with building a security fence  by all means  congress should deal with it .,Democratic
but as far as i know  no committee has been called upon to do that yet .,Democratic
there are important waiver provisions that are available .,Democratic
but waiving all laws for construction is an inappropriate decision .,Democratic
and with all due respect  it is a dangerous precedent that anybody on either side of the aisle should be deeply offended by .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the manager on the democratic side for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this amendment was brought to our attention yesterday evening  and at first blush  this is a shocking correlative point to be made and a comparison to the fugitive slave act of 1850  in which agents were given the broad powers to return freed slaves in free states and return them back to slavery .,Democratic
what we are doing here with bail bondsmen is giving them the ability to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people and also gaining access to incredible private and secret material in data files .,Democratic
and i just wanted to briefly ask the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 what inspired him to add this to a bill that we already had a considerable number of problems about and have never had any hearings on a provision such as this .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from texas .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise  regrettably in opposition to this anti-immigrant legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if we truly believe in all we have heard about the importance of freedom and liberty from our president and others  then we have no other choice but to vote down this bill which denies so much freedom and liberty to the immigrants in our own country .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 includes provision after provision limiting the rights of refugees  imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states  unfunded mandates  making it easier to deport legal immigrants  waiving all federal laws concerning construction of barriers and fences anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights .,Democratic
this is a work of art that has to be examined very  very carefully and very critically .,Democratic
if this measure becomes law  this will close america 's doors to cubans fleeing from their country  religious minorities attempting to escape religious persecution  women fleeing from sex trafficking  rape or forced abortions .,Democratic
unfortunately  in our history  there have been a number of examples of this overreaction in the past .,Democratic
for example  during the civil war  general ulysses grant  no less  sought to expel the jews from the south .,Democratic
the aftermath of world war i brought the notorious red scare  and the very long remembered anti-immigrant palmer raids from the attorney general of that era .,Democratic
of course  world war ii gave us the searing memory of the unconscionable internment of japanese americans .,Democratic
in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy  and even after the patriot act  which did its share of violating the rights of those who were in this country  this legislation would even further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and for which they are not responsible .,Democratic
at some point we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires intelligent response  as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants .,Democratic
for all these reasons  there are so many groups lined up behind the american civil liberties union to oppose the bill : immigration rights groups  civil rights groups  civil liberty organizations  private rights groups  labor organizations  environmental groups  native american rights  states ' rights and international human rights groups .,Democratic
so  i urge us in good conscience and serious concern over the direct and the subtle import of this legislation  please  we can not and should not close ourselves off to the most vulnerable members of our society .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 be permitted to manage the bill on this side of the floor .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to thank the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
meek ) xz4002700 for his work on this .,Democratic
it is credibly important .,Democratic
this is perhaps the most objectionable part of the bill .,Democratic
i rise in support of the nadler/meeks/jackson-lee amendment to strike section 101 of h.r.,Democratic
418 which imposes evidentiary requirements on asylum-seekers fleeing persecution and all immigrants who seek withholding of removal from deportation .,Democratic
without a doubt  if this section passes into law  genuine bona fide refugees who have fled horrible persecution that qualifies them for protection from our government will be returned to face more terror  torture and death at the hands of their persecutors .,Democratic
chairmen sensenbrenner is using the public 's fear of terrorism to radically change asylum law for all asylees  not just those with some connection to terrorism .,Democratic
section 101 will not make us one bit safer from terrorist attack .,Democratic
since we tightened some loopholes in asylum law in 1996  terrorists have not been `` abusing our asylum system '' as the proponents of this bill allege .,Democratic
terrorists are already barred from receiving the benefit of asylum protection in the united states .,Democratic
those who support placing these new insurmountable hurdles on asylum-seekers have used examples of known terrorists to allegedly show that the asylum system makes us vulnerable to terrorist attack .,Democratic
but none of the people they talk about were granted asylum .,Democratic
ramzi yousef and sheik omar abdel rahman  who were both involved in the first world trade center bombing in 1993  were never granted asylum .,Democratic
they filed applications for asylum that had not been adjudicated at the time of the bombing .,Democratic
mir aimal kansi  who killed two cia employees in 1993  was never granted asylum .,Democratic
he had an asylum application pending at the time of the attack .,Democratic
gazi ibrahim abu mezer  known as `` the brooklyn bomber '' for his involvement in a planned attack on the new york city subway in 1997  was never granted asylum .,Democratic
he applied for asylum but withdrew his application before it was reviewed .,Democratic
ahmad ajaj  who was involved in the first world trade center bombing  was never granted asylum his initial application for asylum was abandoned when he left the country  and his second application was denied .,Democratic
abdel hakim tizegha  who was involved in the planned millennium attack in 1999  was never granted asylum .,Democratic
his application was denied in 1997 and his appeal was denied in 1999 .,Democratic
hesham mohamed ali hedayet  who killed two people at the el al counter at los angeles international airport in 2002  was never granted asylum .,Democratic
his application was denied in 1995 .,Democratic
shahawar matin siraj  who has been accused of plotting to bomb the harold square subway station in new york city in august 2004  was never granted asylum .,Democratic
he asserts that he entered the united states legally as a teen  and he later filed an application for asylum that was suspended upon his arrest .,Democratic
immigrants can not apply for asylum unless they are already in the united states .,Democratic
so it is not the fault of the asylum system that these terrorists  and terrorist suspects  entered the united states and section 101 of h.r.,Democratic
418 would not have prevented their entry .,Democratic
in addition  filing an application for asylum should not be equated with actually receiving asylum protection and the right to remain in the united states that it grants .,Democratic
many asylum applications are rejected  just as many tourist visas to enter the united states are rejected .,Democratic
for people applying for asylum in 2005  under current law  extensive security checks are now done through the fbi  cia  homeland security and state department databases .,Democratic
now  expedited removal rules mandate detention for people arriving without proper documents  and grant dhs authority to detain asylum-seekers throughout the adjudication of their application .,Democratic
expedited processing of asylum claims now exists  and applicants are denied work authorizations that may have been a magnet for false applications before asylum reform .,Democratic
people who are already in the united states  who become terrorists while they are here  must be identified by intelligence and law enforcement .,Democratic
if they are  asylum or any other immigration benefit will be revoked under current law .,Democratic
for that vast majority of asylum applicants who have no nexus to terrorism  other than being victims of it  section 101 will create high  new legal standards of evidence  and will severely limit judicial review of their cases .,Democratic
first  the bill requires that refugees prove that one of the five grounds for asylum protection -- race  nationality  membership in a social group  political opinion  or religion -- is the `` central reason '' why they were persecuted .,Democratic
with little access to the documents and witnesses they left behind when fleeing their country  they must prove what was in the mind of their persecutor during the persecution .,Democratic
this would require an asylum-seeker from darfur  sudan to prove that the janjaweed attacked them and ran them off their land because they were black  and not because the militia wanted to steal the immigrant 's cows  for example .,Democratic
second  the bill requires asylum-seekers to show evidence corroborating their testimony  and it would bar judicial review of decisions regarding that evidence .,Democratic
yet many refugees are unable to flee with the people or paperwork that could back up their stories under evidentiary standards .,Democratic
third  the bill allows judges to deny applications if they find inconsistencies between the applicant 's testimony and any statement they have made to a u.s. official  or inconsistencies in witness and documentary evidence that is provided .,Democratic
in addition  it allows denials on the basis of subjective assessments of an applicant 's demeanor  a factor that is frequently misinterpreted by u.s. judges due to cultural differences .,Democratic
thus  a person could be denied asylum due to an immaterial inconsistency in the evidence they present .,Democratic
finally  the bill strips courts from the power to review immigration judge 's discretionary judgments in asylum and removal cases .,Democratic
unfortunately  this bill takes a significant step in turning our country away from its proud history as a nation of refuge for those fleeing persecution .,Democratic
for these reasons  i urge my colleagues to support the nadler/meeks/jackson-lee amendment to strike section 101 of this bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  what i would like to find out  if the gentleman knows  has this ever occurred in the history of federal legislation before that for a given instance all laws  local  state  national  will be waived all at one time for one specific purpose ?,Democratic
i thank the gentleman .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill and the anti-immigrant legislation it contains .,Democratic
if we truly believe all the rhetoric we hear about the importance of freedom and liberty from the president and others  we will vote down this bill  which denies so much freedom and liberty to immigrants in our own country .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
1268 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees  imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states  making it easier to deport legal immigrants  waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states  and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights .,Democratic
if enacted into law  this legislation will close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution and women fleeing sex trafficking and rape .,Democratic
we have been down this road of overreaction in the past .,Democratic
during the civil war  general grant sought to expel the jews from the south .,Democratic
the aftermath of world war i brought about the notorious red scare and the anti-immigrant palmer raids .,Democratic
world war ii led to the unconscionable internment of japanese americans .,Democratic
in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy  and even after the patriot act  this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed  and sins they are not responsible for .,Democratic
at some point  we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an intelligence response  as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants .,Democratic
it is for all these reasons that so many groups strongly oppose this bill  including groups concerned about immigrant rights  civil rights and liberties  privacy rights ; labor rights ; the environment ; native-american rights ; state rights  and international human rights .,Democratic
i urge a `` no '' vote .,Democratic
we can not and should not close ourselves off to the most vulnerable members of our society .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment .,Democratic
this is a lot of money we are talking about .,Democratic
as the late everett dirksen said  a billion here  a billion there  pretty soon you have got some real money .,Democratic
we are talking about $ 200 billion .,Democratic
and we all support our warfighters .,Democratic
we support our men and women in uniform  but we should not throw money at any problem .,Democratic
and all this amendment asks is that we copy the truman commission where a democratic senator investigated a democratic president .,Democratic
this should not be a partisan issue at all .,Democratic
both parties should unite .,Democratic
and i congratulate the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 for his strong work in this worthy effort .,Democratic
republicans should want a real-time bipartisan look at what is really going on .,Democratic
i had the good fortune of being in baghdad last christmas .,Democratic
our c-130 was broken  so we spent a little extra time at the baghdad airport .,Democratic
a shipment came in that our military did not want us to see .,Democratic
but i had my video camera handy  and i took pictures .,Democratic
what was it ?,Democratic
six large pallets  off-loaded from u.s. aircraft  beautifully packaged  you could tell  lots of small boxes on each pallet  very heavy to lift .,Democratic
what was in those boxes ?,Democratic
answer  $ 1.4 billion  billion with a b as in `` boy  '' $ 1.4 billion of u.s. currency shipped in allegedly to replenish the iraqi central bank .,Democratic
well  i hope and pray that was true .,Democratic
but when our own paul bremer says he really can not account for $ 9 billion of money  when eyewitnesses see 300 million in u.s. cash being flown out of the country  allegedly to buy arms for the good guys  you have got to wonder .,Democratic
all we are asking for here is accountability .,Democratic
and i want to pay special tribute to my friend  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
thompson ) xz4004032  a leading member of the blue dog coalition .,Democratic
what we want is accountability .,Democratic
we are fiscal and defense hawks  but we need to know where the money goes .,Democratic
the taxpayers of this country deserve no less .,Democratic
this is as far from a partisan issue as you can get .,Democratic
all we want is accountability because catching fraud  waste  and abuse is the most bipartisan of issues .,Democratic
so i congratulate my friend  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
thompson ) xz4004032  also the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 .,Democratic
this needs to be in the bill because these supplementals  they are becoming a habit  guys .,Democratic
every year we are going to have a major supplemental .,Democratic
and it is high time that we find out where the money went .,Democratic
support the tierney amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i just wanted to ask the author of the amendment  would he have objected to having hearings on his amendment ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  what i would have asked the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Democratic
gingrey ) xz4001510  had he been willing to yield some time  was to show me where in the 9/11 report it makes any reference to making any of the changes in the asylum law that are being proposed by the majority here in this bill .,Democratic
there is no reference to that whatsoever  because the 9/11 commission knew that terrorists and threats to national security can not get asylum .,Democratic
instead  the majority  because it does not agree with the commission on religious freedom  because it does not accept fundamental traditions of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender  they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum  they dump a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with terrorism in here  not recommended by the 9/11 commission report  and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
mr. speaker  while i have problems with the concept of this supplemental and supplementals  and the misplaced budget priorities of the republican party  this bill  i believe  is needed for our men and women who are fighting the war on terrorism .,Democratic
this bill includes much needed higher death benefits for our military .,Democratic
and while it will never return these patriots such as christian engeldrum in my district to his family  what we can do as americans is ensure that his wife and children have financial security for his personal sacrifice to his country .,Democratic
this bill finally provides funding for body armor for our troops  something that this administration has refused to do for over 2 years now .,Democratic
so hopefully less families can claim the new death benefits for their loved ones fighting overseas .,Democratic
this bill provides much needed aid for the victims of the december tsunami .,Democratic
i led a delegation to sri lanka in january  and i saw first hand the resources needed in that country  multiplied by the effects on other countries ; and this money will go to good use .,Democratic
this funding  along with the sheer generosity of the american people  is a true testament of our country in comparison to the tepid actions by the white house in the immediate days after the crisis .,Democratic
while this money is important  i would be remiss if i did not express my disappointment at no funding being included for the u.n .,Democratic
population fund for children and maternal health care in the tsunami region .,Democratic
i offered an amendment to fix this  but yet again this administration has played politics and refuses to fund the unfpa .,Democratic
this bill provides $ 50 million in important aid to the state of israel as they embark on the critical disengagement plan and withdraw from the gaza strip .,Democratic
we have the support  the courage of the israeli people ; and this is the right thing to do at this time .,Democratic
and  finally  this bill includes important language to create the 9/11 heroes medal of valor  for which i am deeply indebted to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
wolf ) xz4004350  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
serrano ) xz4003660  the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
oxley ) xz4003070  and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
frank ) xz4001400 for including this provision in this bill .,Democratic
on behalf of my cousin  john moran  who was killed on 9/11  a battalion chief of the fire department of new york  and the over 400 families in new york city that are affected by this legislation  i want to say thank you for this honor that is going to be bestowed by the president in september of this year .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i do want to close  if there are no further speakers  and acknowledge that we have important work to be done here .,Democratic
we have highly professional personnel at the border  and they are doing their job  but we need to provide more of them .,Democratic
we need to fund the border security proposals that we have been putting forward for some time .,Democratic
we need to be sure that we fund those .,Democratic
but the other piece of that  and i am delighted that the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Democratic
kolbe ) xz4002260 has brought that forward  is to be certain that the most sophisticated applications of that technology are used on the border .,Democratic
i speak to many companies in san diego .,Democratic
i know that they have a great interest in this .,Democratic
they have been a part of some of these solutions in the past .,Democratic
let us employ them ; let us be sure that we are doing this in a comprehensive fashion .,Democratic
so i want to thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Democratic
kolbe ) xz4002260 .,Democratic
we must move forward in this area .,Democratic
we can do a far better job on the border than we have done before .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to thank my colleague from monterey for so clearly laying out the reasons that waiving all laws is a travesty of american governing principles .,Democratic
i will focus on the issue driving this extreme language -- completing the 3 1/2 miles of border fencing  including the ocean section in my district .,Democratic
a member stated that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants enter there and are chased all over the sensitive wetlands destroying them anyway .,Democratic
his facts were true 10 years ago .,Democratic
they are not today .,Democratic
in 1993  the border patrol apprehended 165  000 people in this section .,Democratic
in 2003  the number had dropped 94 percent -- to 10  000 .,Democratic
how many illegal entrants get past the border patrol today ?,Democratic
they tell us 1  000 a year -- three people per day .,Democratic
and that is with a fence you or i could easily walk around or through .,Democratic
what should we do ?,Democratic
finish building a secondary fence with the proposed level of environmental destruction .,Democratic
compromise has occurred  and plans exist for alternative road alignment .,Democratic
appoint a task force to meet and reach consensus by a deadline .,Democratic
one issue remains -- a one-half mile wide river bed called smuggler 's gulch -- leading to internationally recognized wetlands restored at the cost of tens of millions of dollars .,Democratic
the proposal lops off two adjacent mesas to dump 2 million tons of dirt into the gap to a height of 165 feet !,Democratic
-- as high as two of the new giant airbuses stacked on top of one another !,Democratic
it would cost $ 40 million just to move the dirt -- money better spent purchasing high grade technology and funding the president 's proposed increase of border patrol agents .,Democratic
i urge you to support the farr amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i want to comment briefly on the $ 82 billion spending bill that will be approved today for the ongoing u.s. military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
i will support this bill .,Democratic
i am pleased it includes additional money for body armor and armored vehicles for our troops .,Democratic
it includes money to purchase bomb-jamming devices to protect our troops from roadside bombs .,Democratic
i also support the improved life insurance death benefits for military personnel and their families .,Democratic
and  i am hopeful that the additional funds that are in the bill to train and equip security forces in iraq all afghanistan will be expeditious and well spent .,Democratic
this money is critical if afghan and iraqi forces are to take over security duties from american troops  which will allow our men and women to finally come home .,Democratic
i have called for negotiating a timeline for the withdrawal of american troops with the new iraqi government  hopefully to be completed within the year .,Democratic
but  for that to become a reality  well-equipped and competent security forces in iraq and afghanistan must be prepared to take our place .,Democratic
this bill will help achieve that goal .,Democratic
i am also pleased that the final bill retained language inserted in the senate directing the president to include future requests to fund the u.s. presence in iraq in his regular budget .,Democratic
we have been in iraq for more than two years and in afghanistan for more than three years .,Democratic
the fact that we still have troops in iraq should not come as a surprise to the budget writers at the white house and the pentagon .,Democratic
it is not appropriate to continue funding these long-term  ongoing operations via supplemental appropriations bills  which are considered outside of the normal budget procedures and restrictions .,Democratic
while i support the bill  i am outraged that  more than two years after the u. s. invaded iraq  the pentagon leadership has not gotten their act together to adequately protect our troops and to come up with a plan to get them home .,Democratic
as columnist mark shields pointed out late last year  in the three years immediately after pearl harbor  the united states produced the following to win world war ii : 296  429 aircraft  102  3351 tanks  87  620 warships  and 2  455  694 trucks .,Democratic
at the time  the u.s. population was 132 million and the size of our economy was less than $ 100 billion .,Democratic
yet  approaching three years into the u.s. occupation of iraq  the united states  with a population of almost 300 million and defense spending of $ 500 billion a year  under the failed leadership of the pentagon  only 6  000 of the nearly 20  000 humvees in iraq are factory armored versions and more than 8  000 of the 9  128 medium and heavy trucks used in iraq are without armor .,Democratic
despite repeated promises from the pentagon leadership that the situation is getting better  a recent article in the new york times showed that the emperor has no clothes .,Democratic
as the article details  one marine company has returned home to expose the reality of their tour in iraq  `` one they say was punctuated not only by a lack of armor  but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in battle  destroyed morale and ruined the careers of some of their most competent warriors.,Democratic
'' i have heard similar stories from the oregon national guard members i have talked to .,Democratic
how did this happen ?,Democratic
since the september 11  2001  terrorist attacks against our country ; congress has provided the pentagon with $ 1.6 trillion -- $ 167 billion in supplemental appropriations bills for fiscal years 2001-2005 ; and $ 1.45 trillion in regular defense appropriations for fiscal years 2002-2005 .,Democratic
today 's bill will add $ 75 billion or so to the pentagon budget .,Democratic
given that level of funding  it is hard to understand why our troops continue to suffer shortages of critical equipment .,Democratic
it is hard to understand until you remember that secretary rumsfeld and the other civilian leaders at the pentagon argued that our troops would be greeted in iraq as liberators with flowers and candy  not the bullets and bombs that have led to more than 1  500 of our soldiers getting killed .,Democratic
before  the invasion  the pentagon planned to reduce our troop levels to 20  000-30  000 within a few weeks of overthrowing saddam hussein .,Democratic
the fact that 150  000 u.s. troops remain in iraq more than a year and a half after the war began shows how badly the pentagon leadership miscalculated the post-war situation .,Democratic
those miscalculations also led the pentagon to vastly underestimate the equipment that our troops would need to survive and succeed in iraq .,Democratic
first  the pentagon leadership did not even order the necessary equipment like body armor  armored humvees and bomb jamming devices .,Democratic
for example  under the pentagon 's original war plan  the pentagon planned to have only 235 armored humvees in iraq for the 20  000 troops who would remain after overthrowing saddam hussein .,Democratic
then  when it became clear that this equipment was necessary  the pentagon did not procure it with any sense of urgency .,Democratic
as the new york times article i mentioned above noted  `` the army 's procurement system  which also supplies the marines  has come under fierce criticism for underperforming in the war  and to this day it has only one small contractor in ohio armoring new humvees.,Democratic
'' the performance of secretary rumsfeld and his senior leadership at the pentagon has been a disgrace .,Democratic
unfortunately  it is our troops who have had to pay the price .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act .,Democratic
not only has the house failed to consider the sweeping changes in this bill through the thoughtful and deliberative committee process  we have failed our duty to the american people to ensure that this bill will not have unintended consequences .,Democratic
you may ask  `` dingell  what unintended consequences ?,Democratic
does n't this bill just keep the bad guys from harming us again ?,Democratic
`` well  my friends  read the fine print .,Democratic
look at section 102 of the bill .,Democratic
that section allows the secretary of homeland security to waive any and all federal  state  or local law that the secretary determines should be waived to ensure the construction of physical barriers and roads to deter illegal border crossings .,Democratic
it would also allow waiver of laws to knock down existing structures or other obstacles .,Democratic
it would give power to the secretary of homeland security to waive any public health law such as the safe drinking water act  the clean water act  as well as transportation safety  hazardous materials transportation and road construction standards .,Democratic
in addition  it would grant dhs unchecked authority to abrogate criminal law  child labor laws  laws that protect workers  civil rights laws  ethics laws for clean contracting and procurement policy .,Democratic
it goes even further .,Democratic
no procedures for using this authority are established  and judicial review by federal or state courts is expressly prohibited .,Democratic
it even appears there would be no judicial review concerning the taking of private property .,Democratic
the breadth of this provision is unprecedented and must not stand .,Democratic
now let 's look at section 101 .,Democratic
this section requires that in certain asylum claims  applicants must prove that their race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion `` was or will be a central reason '' for their persecution .,Democratic
in effect  this will bar many legitimate refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses  including torture  rape  and other horrific violence  from receiving asylum .,Democratic
this section creates new burdens on those seeking asylum  including a corroborating evidence test  empowering an immigration officer or immigration judge to deny asylum to a refugee because he believes  in his discretion  that the refugee should have somehow been able to obtain a particular document when fleeing her country .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i understand that we must protect our borders  but we must still allow those decent freedom loving people fleeing their countries to be able to continue to seek asylum .,Democratic
i would also note that sec .,Democratic
103 specifically identifies officers  officials  representatives or spokesmen of the palestinian liberation organization as terrorists  thus not able to enter the united states .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this would mean that palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas would be barred from the united states .,Democratic
given the great progress we have seen in the middle east in the past week and that the bush administration is in the process of setting up meetings with dr .,Democratic
abbas in washington  it hardly seems wise to pass a bill barring the newly elected president of the palestinian authority from the country .,Democratic
finally  i note that i have concerns about this bill and its unintended consequences on the second amendment rights of gun owning americans like myself .,Democratic
section 203 calls for the linking of databases and creates a floor for the requirements of what can be included in the database .,Democratic
however  this legislation fails to create a ceiling .,Democratic
what could stop a state from requiring databases to contain information about gun licenses issued and gun ownership records ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to oppose this broad overreaching legislation .,Democratic
let 's have hearings .,Democratic
let 's have real deliberation and debate .,Democratic
i will vote against this legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  although i support the amendment  i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the war supplemental appropriations act but must voice my incredible misgivings for what the republican majority has attached to legislation that should solely be about how we provide for our brave men and women in harm 's way in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
there is much in this bill to be proud of .,Democratic
our military  despite the job of the civilian brass and this congress  have been performing heroically .,Democratic
they have accomplished much more than we could have ever hoped for  and if any fault needs to be assigned it is to the policy makers  and not to those in uniform .,Democratic
however  i am ashamed that this body has taken something as important as securing our troops  and attached a hastily considered immigration provision that will result in massive unfunded mandates being passed on to our states .,Democratic
i am ashamed that the conference committee removed language that would have created a truman-style commission to examine war profiteering  largely to ensure that this administration would not be embarrassed .,Democratic
finally  i am ashamed that this congress has turned its back on a promise made by our president to the palestinian authority to help improve the situation of the palestinian people and further the cause of peace for all in the middle east .,Democratic
i am concerned that the immigration provisions will force our great nation to turn our back on the thousands of political and human rights asylum seekers who look toward america as their last and best hope .,Democratic
the real id act will force the most vulnerable to have their torturers corroborate their tales of persecution .,Democratic
i understand that we must protect our borders  and i understand that changes must be made to keep out those that seek to do us harm .,Democratic
but we should not hastily foreclose the dream and promise of america because of fear .,Democratic
we should not send back asylum seekers back to their torturers .,Democratic
under these standards  iraqis seeking to escape the rape rooms of saddam hussein would have been sent back to the ba'athist prisons if they fled iraq without the proper documentation .,Democratic
i am also dismayed that rather than seeking to be responsible stewards of the public 's trust  the republican majority in charge of congress once again decided to ignore its oversight responsibilities .,Democratic
it seems that rather than doing our oversight job as a separate and equal branch of government  the gop leadership would rather save the bush administration and corporate ceos some embarrassment .,Democratic
i am old enough to remember the truman commission .,Democratic
i remember that sen .,Democratic
truman went against a democratic administration  and saved our military and our tax payers billions of dollars in waste and fraud .,Democratic
i can not understand why we do not do the same .,Democratic
my friends on the other side of the aisle should be ashamed of the fact that mr.,Democratic
waxman and i have probably done more on this front from the minority  than has anyone with a gavel .,Democratic
reconstructing iraq and afghanistan is too important not to get it right  but confronted yet again with evidence of massive fraud and egregious war profiteering  my republican colleagues are again choosing to bury their heads in the sand  plug their ears  and turn out the lights on our duty .,Democratic
finally  this bill  by intention or not  has the potential of undoing all the progress that the middle east peace process has made since the death of yasser arafat .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the new president of the palestinian authority is in an almost untenable position .,Democratic
in order for palestinian democracy to succeed over radical terrorism  president abbas must be provided with the resources to open hospitals  create jobs  arm a police force  build jails  and take the fight to the terrorists .,Democratic
president bush recognized this .,Democratic
he made a statement asking for $ 200 million to support a nascent middle eastern democracy .,Democratic
instead of allowing president abbas to use american aid to build his security forces to take on terror  we instead set him up for failure .,Democratic
my friends  if you want to see hamas win the upcoming municipal elections ; if you want to see the peace process come to an abject halt ; if you want to see more dead young israelis and young palestinians you should support this language .,Democratic
it surprises me that the only thing that this congress is capable of bucking and embarrassing this administration on is the prospect of peace .,Democratic
i hope  for the sake of peace  we can correct this colossal error in judgment and that the president and the state department speak out against congress ' ill-advised policy making on this most tragic conflict .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the real id act is a real travesty .,Democratic
it has little to do with homeland security  and it represents just the latest in a string of anti-immigrant proposals so unfortunately popular with certain of our republican colleagues .,Democratic
instead of putting the safety of our families first  these are the same folks that would have turned our emergency room doctors into border patrol agents ; who would have cut the funding to cities that did not conduct immigration raids ; and who would interfere with the people with whom our private banking institutions could serve and encourage instead an underground  black market financial system .,Democratic
this same anti-immigrant fervor continues to fuel this bad bill .,Democratic
the real id act is designed to make our roads real unsafe .,Democratic
undocumented workers will be on our roads .,Democratic
that is why the austin police department believes that texans would be safer if the law allowed all drivers to obtain licenses .,Democratic
as assistant police chief rudy landeros testified  `` in allowing the community the opportunity to obtain driver 's licenses  they will have to pass a driver 's test  and that will make them not only informed drivers  but safer drivers.,Democratic
'' the texas legislature  in a bill by former representative miguel wise  wisely recognized that requiring all drivers to obtain licenses would make texas families safer .,Democratic
had it not been for the veto by texas 's myopic governor  this common-sense call for public safety would be the law in the president 's home state .,Democratic
legal immigrants could also be denied a license .,Democratic
paula waddle  an immigration attorney in the rio grande valley  explained that her clients are having delays of as much as 15 months in getting their legal permanent residency papers because of confusion at the department of homeland security .,Democratic
if these legal immigrants do not have sufficient paperwork to prove their legal status  they will be caught up in this same web of anti-immigrant fervor and denied the opportunity to obtain insurance and drive .,Democratic
ironically  consideration of this bill coincides with the release this week by the u.s. commission on international religious freedom .,Democratic
this proposal would worsen the plight of those whose conditions were the subject of investigation by that commission : asylum-seekers who already face deplorable conditions  who are often treated like common criminals and thrown into jail with common criminals  and who are subject to strip searches as well as solitary confinement .,Democratic
but since current law already bars those who presnet a secruity risk from getting asylum  the additional restrictions in this bill would not make us safer .,Democratic
we must not sacrifice our democracy in a misguided attempt to save it .,Democratic
this bill strikes the wrong balance .,Democratic
anti-immigrant hysteria can not be permitted to drive an agenda that makes us less safe  less healthy  and erodes our civil liberties while failing to address real terrorist threats .,Democratic
the real id bill ought to be really rejected fast by this congress .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as someone who for the past 2 years has represented over 40  000 soldiers at fort hood  texas  who have fought for our country in iraq  i am deeply appreciative of the expeditious manner in which the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis )  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000  the gentleman from florida ( chairman young )  and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860 have worked together to pass this important piece of legislation .,Democratic
this bill sends a very clear message to our troops in harm 's way that while americans may have differences of opinion about the iraqi war  the fact is that we are all unified when it comes to seeing that our troops in harm 's way have all of the support that they need and deserve to do their mission and to come home safely to their families .,Democratic
in the area of responsibility for the subcommittee on which i serve under the committee on appropriations  the military quality of life and veterans affairs  and related agencies subcommittee  i wholeheartedly support the language and funding in this bill .,Democratic
under our subcommittee is $ 3.1 billion in funding  $ 175 million of which goes to the department of defense health care system to deal with the direct increased costs for health care for our wounded troops coming home ; $ 1.5 billion to pay for housing allowance for our guard and reserve soldiers and their families ; and $ 1.3 billion in military construction needed in iraq and afghanistan and throughout our country to support our war against terrorism .,Democratic
i enthusiastically and wholeheartedly support this bill .,Democratic
i do want  mr.,Democratic
chairman  to express one concern .,Democratic
the fact is that as of the end of december of last year  there have been 48  000 american troops coming home who have needed health care from the veterans administration health care system .,Democratic
while we put $ 175 million in the dod part of this budget to take care of extra dod health care costs  there is not a dime in this supplemental appropriation bill to help the veterans administration deal with the cost of dealing with 48  000 and still counting troops who have needed va health care .,Democratic
using the va secretary 's own testimony before our subcommittee last week  the average cost mathematically is $ 6  200 for treatment for each veteran within the va health care system .,Democratic
multiply that number by the 48  000 troops coming back from iraq and afghanistan  and we are talking about an additional $ 302 million of cost to the va health care system to help provide needed care for these deserving patriots .,Democratic
i do not think that money ought to come out of the hide of va health care services to other veterans  and i do not think we should cut corners in terms of quality of care for iraqi and afghanistan war veterans once they have left the department of defense system and gone into the va system .,Democratic
in committee we heard some say the va is flush with money .,Democratic
i have looked into that statement  and the fact is that the va is presently laying off hundreds of employees in the va medical system and taking money out of their equipment accounts to fund their personnel accounts .,Democratic
during time of war and in the spirit of this bill supporting our troops not only when they are in the combat zone but when they return home  i think in that spirit we ought to  as this bill goes to conference committee  look specifically at what additional needs the va health care system needs  provide the quality medical care that these troops need .,Democratic
if the war is worth fighting  certainly it is worth paying for and it is worth supporting those troops even after they have left the military and continue to pay the mental and physical price for decades for having stood up for our country .,Democratic
so i would like to urge the committee chairman  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000  the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860  and the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
young ) xz4004391 to work together with us on a bipartisan basis to see that we can add the needed money for the va health care system  to see that we do not shortchange these great americans who have risked their lives for our country .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the bill  although i am disgusted with the anti-immigration provisions in it  particularly the things with the driver 's licenses .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of this supplemental appropriations bill  but not without very serious misgivings .,Democratic
i will vote for this legislation because it contains support for our troops in the field and important tsunami relief .,Democratic
with american soldiers in harm 's way  i am very reluctant to vote against funding of military operations .,Democratic
and  having personally seen the devastation in the wake of the tsunami in indonesia  i feel that aid to the victims is critical .,Democratic
nevertheless  i am disgusted by the process by which this legislation came to the floor and by the immigration-related provisions in the bill .,Democratic
this is an appropriations bill .,Democratic
it is not the place to write new immigration law or to include seriously flawed driver 's license provisions .,Democratic
the republicans are clamoring in the senate about the lack of up or down votes on judges and  today  they denied the house not only an up or down vote on the so-called `` real id '' act  but even a real debate on this issue .,Democratic
the immigration sections are seriously flawed .,Democratic
they impose onerous restrictions on foreign nationals in the u.s.  not to mention upon american citizens  and slap a massive unfunded mandate upon the states .,Democratic
shortly after this legislation takes effect  i can only imagine that  instead of more licensed drivers on the roads  there will be less .,Democratic
instead of safer roads  we will have more reckless drivers operating completely outside of our laws .,Democratic
america is a nation of immigrants and our strength is in our diversity .,Democratic
we are founded upon the people who have come from all corners of the globe and are continually enriched by the unique strengths that they add to our national mosaic .,Democratic
we must not undermine the careful balance our nation has struck .,Democratic
i  therefore  strongly oppose these id and immigration-related sections and pledge to fight hard in the future to remove the offensive provisions from the law .,Democratic
in the end  as a legislator  i must vote on the bill in front of me  and in this instance i must vote for the vital funding contained in this bill .,Democratic
but  mr.,Democratic
speaker  please know that i will work hard in the day ahead to strike the dangerously flawed sections from the code .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
although i support the goals of this legislation  h.r.,Democratic
418 unfortunately contains too many misguided provisions .,Democratic
last year  i voted to pass the 9/11 commission 's bipartisan recommendations to reform identification standards and beef up security on our nation 's border .,Democratic
this legislation would repeal that new law before it has a chance to work .,Democratic
had the provisions of h.r.,Democratic
418 been in place prior to september 11  2001  they would not have stopped a single one of the 19 terrorists .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 would force virtually every adult in the united states to go to the dmv to get a new driver 's license  and with 14  000 local jurisdictions in this country currently issuing identification  it would be impossible to impose a single standard within in the three-year limit in the bill .,Democratic
i will also vote to remove provisions,Democratic
mr. chairman  i need my friend to know that they are in the process of having the claim heard .,Democratic
it has not been terminated or it is not all over .,Democratic
but we are arguing the substance .,Democratic
what i was trying to figure out is  what inspired the gentleman at this late point in the proceedings  since we had hearings last year  we had no hearings this year  and we just found out about this yesterday .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from michigan .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time do i have remaining ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  it has never been done before  waiving all labor laws  all contract laws  all small business laws  all laws relating to sacred places .,Democratic
it is a broad sweep  just a total repeal of all of those laws or a waiver of all those laws .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
harman ) xz4001660 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
i have been watching this debate all morning  and i am really concerned about what is happening here on the floor of the house of representatives .,Democratic
i have never heard so much misstatement of fact about a piece of legislation that is very important .,Democratic
the problem is  this legislation never had a hearing in committee  never had public review .,Democratic
we have never looked at the language ; i doubt that any members have read the bill in its entirety .,Democratic
that is not what this house is all about  because this law is a very  very serious law  and it is going to affect people 's lives .,Democratic
i have heard statements here on the floor that the recommendations in this bill are in the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
let me give an example .,Democratic
section 102  which deals with the border fence  the commission never even mentioned the border fence .,Democratic
why ?,Democratic
because it is not a problem .,Democratic
we have been building it .,Democratic
what we have run into is a couple of environmental snags .,Democratic
so what does this bill do ?,Democratic
it says okay  waive all that .,Democratic
waive the law .,Democratic
this is a precedent that has never been done before in the united states congress .,Democratic
waive all laws  whether those laws pertain to indian burial grounds  whether they are labor laws  discrimination laws  small business laws  environmental laws .,Democratic
we will just waive them .,Democratic
and guess what  no court  as it says  `` no court shall have jurisdiction.,Democratic
'' what kind of a measure is this ?,Democratic
do we just run into problems and we come to the floor of congress and say  just get rid of the law ?,Democratic
here is a country that celebrated the tearing down of the berlin wall  a country that celebrated the elections in iraq so people will have the rule of law ; and then when we have the rule of law  we just waive it .,Democratic
there was no request from the state of california for this bill .,Democratic
mexico  our biggest trade partner  nothing like this ; and what we are saying to the world is  do not worry  we are just going to cram through everything and forget the law .,Democratic
this is wrong  and i am going to have an amendment on the floor tomorrow to repeal it .,Democratic
i hope everyone votes for it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time do we have remaining ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  section 101  the asylum provisions  are flawed .,Democratic
existing law exempts and prohibits terrorists or threats to national security or those who the government can prove through secret evidence are threats to national security from getting asylum .,Democratic
that is existing law .,Democratic
this self-executing rule  which allows amendments which have never been considered by any committee or heard through hearing or markup  do several dangerous things .,Democratic
section 101 encourages asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim simply because the applicant was able to recall or recount information later in the process that she did not mention when she was initially encountered by immigration officers .,Democratic
the amendment included in the rule would expand that to include consistency on matters that are entirely relevant to the basis of the claim for asylum .,Democratic
it would mean that a woman who has been subjected to gang rape by government armed forces in her country who is too afraid or ashamed to tell the fact to the armed male immigration officer she first encounters at the airport in the united states could  if she tells the story later on in the process  be denied asylum simply because she was too afraid or too ashamed to tell the story to the first person she encountered .,Democratic
now  under the amendment  this woman could be denied asylum because she can not recall facts that are irrelevant to establishing her need from protection  her high school graduation date  for example .,Democratic
in a system where we rely on translations and statements taken from people in crisis  this is a very change in the law .,Democratic
it is a fundamental challenge to the whole concept of the immigration judge considering all things coming into the record .,Democratic
the one thing i know is if section 101 becomes law  people with a well-founded fear of persecution  as a result of these changes  will be denied asylum  there will be no effort whatsoever to enhance our efforts to protect this country against terrorism  but we will have struck a fundamental blow against a tradition which i think is very important to maintain in this country and that is that we are a haven for refugees from persecution for political  ethnic  religious  gender reasons .,Democratic
i urge a `` no '' vote on the rule and a `` no '' vote on the bill .,Democratic
even more troubling is a fact discussed in a report released this week by the u.s. commission on international religious freedom .,Democratic
often immigration judges determine that an applicant is not credible because their statement at the airport was inconsistent with later statements because later statements included more detail .,Democratic
the problem with that logic is that when an asylum applicant is interviewed in inspections  the interview stops at the moment that the person establishes a fear of persecution .,Democratic
they are not invited to provide more detail until a later credible fear interview .,Democratic
in other words  the applicant is n't the reason the details are not included .,Democratic
this bill would codify this preposterous failure of the immigration judges ' logic in these cases .,Democratic
section 101 also would encourage asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim because of perceived problems with an applicant 's demeanor .,Democratic
this would mean that a woman subjected to persecution by the taliban who has been taught that she should not make eye contact with a man could be denied asylum simply because she did not make eye contact with the male immigration officer interviewing her .,Democratic
furthermore  it is quite common for torture survivors suffering from post-traumatic stress to exhibit characteristics in their demeanor such as lack of eye contact  the inability to recall simple details that to an untrained person may appear to be symptoms of lying .,Democratic
for example  fauyiza kassindja  a young togolese woman who fled female genital mutilation ( fgm )  would have been denied asylum under this standard with little chance of getting that determination reversed on appeal .,Democratic
under current law  the board of immigration appeals rightly reversed the immigration judge 's credibility finding in her case  and that decision has helped protect other women fleeing fgm .,Democratic
section 101 would encourage asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim when the applicant can not provide corroborating evidence of their claims if the officer  in his unreviewable discretion  believes that the applicant should be able to provide such evidence .,Democratic
this disproportionately harms applicants who are detained and/or lack counsel .,Democratic
relatedly  h.r.,Democratic
418 would constrain judicial review of a denial of asylum based on an applicant 's failure to provide corroborating evidence .,Democratic
section 101 would require some asylum applicants to prove not only that they are refugees  but also prove their persecutors ' central reason .,Democratic
the additional burden on asylum applicants created by this provision is impermissible under the international law  including the u.n .,Democratic
convention on refugees to which the united states is a signatory .,Democratic
to meet the standard set forth in the convention  it is sufficient to show persecution is motivated in part by one of the prohibited grounds .,Democratic
asking a refugee or asylum applicant to parse his persecutor 's motivations so finely as to distill the `` central reason '' or `` central reason '' is asking asylum the proponents of section 101 assert that we must enact this section in order to prevent terrorists from gaining asylum .,Democratic
my friends who are the authors of this provision are in error  however  in this assertion .,Democratic
i have been informed by my staff that while several persons with terrorist connections have applied for asylum over the years  the department of homeland security has not found a single terrorist has ever been granted asylum in the united states .,Democratic
this is because  first  current law appropriately makes terrorists ineligible for asylum  and second  the standard for granting asylum is already so high that applicants are subjected to intense scrutiny before a decision on their claims is made .,Democratic
while the united states has not  as far as the department of homeland security knows  ever granted asylum to a terrorist  there was  indeed  a problem more than a decade ago whereby persons could apply for asylum and then be paroled into the united states while their claims were pending .,Democratic
that is no longer possible today .,Democratic
a person who applies for asylum today is held in detention until an investigation is made on the credibility of their claim and on whether they pose a security risk to the united states .,Democratic
in conclusion  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the consequences for asylum seekers to enactment of section 101 could be catastrophic .,Democratic
the new standards could make it far more difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prove their claims .,Democratic
after all  would an asylum officer in 1938 have found jews ' claims of being thrown into the death camps and ovens of nazi germany credible ?,Democratic
would the victims of the nazi death camps have been able to present corroboration of the specific facts asserting their claims ?,Democratic
if a bosnian woman who has faced rape at the hands of government agents as a systematic form of persecution is ashamed or afraid to relate her rapes in her initial interviews  should that be an automatic ground to find her not credible ?,Democratic
it is unclear what really motivated the drafters of h.r.,Democratic
418 to put section 101 into this measure .,Democratic
two things are clear  however : the provision has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism  and it was not recommended by the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
let me repeat that  because yesterday a member of the majority claimed this bill was simply enacting recommendations of the commission .,Democratic
the chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 commission have clearly and specifically rejected that these asylum provisions are supported by their recommendations .,Democratic
we should consider changes to our asylum laws in a sober and reflective manner after hearings  subcommittee consideration  and full committee consideration .,Democratic
neither section 101 of h.r.,Democratic
418 nor any of the other provisions of this bill had a single hearing or markup .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to stand against this rule and if the rule is not defeated  i implore you to support the amendment that will be offered later today to strike section 101 in its entirety .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
ortiz ) xz4003020 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today in opposition to the emergency supplemental appropriations ( hr 1268 )  on substance and process .,Democratic
i am strongly supportive of our fighting men and women  and mourn the loss of nearly 1  600 americans who have died in iraq  four of whom resided in my congressional district .,Democratic
on substance  this bill fails to provide an exit strategy for our troops in iraq .,Democratic
since iraq held democratic elections in january  the us should have been implementing an aggressive exit strategy that includes a timetable for the training of iraqi security forces  so us troops can return home .,Democratic
moreover  with nearly $ 10 billion already appropriated but not spent for critical reconstruction projects in iraq  like rebuilding electrical grids and establishing telecommunications networks  us policy objectives for iraqi independence are jeopardized .,Democratic
on process  many of the items in this bill should be funded under the regular order in the annual appropriations cycle .,Democratic
unfortunately  the republican leadership has used this bill as a vehicle for passage of immigration measures that are divisive and harmful for our country  and could n't be passed as stand-alone bills .,Democratic
provisions commonly known as the `` real id act '' regarding national driver 's license standards  asylum law and completion of a southern border fence have been controversial from day one  but were added to appease a vocal minority of anti-immigrant advocates .,Democratic
i and many others in congress would like to have a rational debate on immigration reform  but we are denied the opportunity when the leadership attaches non-germane immigration measures to a funding bill .,Democratic
to better demonstrate how the process has been hijacked by a minority of the majority  many of the same provisions that constitute the real id provisions in the supplemental being considered today were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( pl 108-458 ) in conference because of their extreme nature .,Democratic
one of the most egregious provisions in the real id section of the supplemental is the blanket authority given to the secretary of homeland security to expedite construction of the remaining three miles of the southern border fence in san diego .,Democratic
all americans should be concerned that the dhs secretary has carte blanche authority to waive any and all laws in the name of border security .,Democratic
this provision is a dangerous attack against the civil rights of all americans  when any law can be waived under the guise of border security .,Democratic
blanket authority to complete the three mile border fence is especially `` in your face '' politics when  under current law  the dhs secretary already has a national security waiver for the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act .,Democratic
we must work harder to strike a balance between our national security and environmental protection  not simply ignore environmental laws .,Democratic
furthermore  the driver 's license provisions of this bill touted in the name of national security are equally concerning .,Democratic
it is indeed ironic that these provisions would not have stopped the 9/11 hijackers from obtaining driver 's licenses .,Democratic
the breach of our border security was a result of the hijackers having been issued legal visas to enter the us  which many of them used to apply for driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
even if the real id provisions had been in place before the 9/11 attacks  the hijackers still would have been able to obtain a driver 's license or state-issued id .,Democratic
again  a minority of the majority is playing on the fears of this nation to enact a flawed policy that does not actually address the problem it purports to fix .,Democratic
for the record  i do not support illegal immigration  but i do support a regulated process for immigrants who enter the us legally  pay their taxes and play by the rules to earn us citizenship .,Democratic
no one can deny that comprehensive immigration reform is a topic on the minds of our constituents -- but such a critical policy debate should be conducted on its own merits .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Democratic
we have heard a lot of talk here today  and i submit that this is not the answer  to emasculate all the laws .,Democratic
i would bet that if the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
hunter ) xz4001910  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
cunningham ) xz4000910  myself and any other interested party sat down  one meeting with all the interested parties  we could resolve this .,Democratic
but that is not the way they want to proceed .,Democratic
this was not a recommendation of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
this is essentially emasculating all laws to get an environmental project completed .,Democratic
and emasculating all laws is not the way to do it .,Democratic
this amendment is a good amendment because it does not allow my colleagues to emasculate all laws .,Democratic
what it allows us to do is to let this process work .,Democratic
and with the pressure that has been brought here today  we can get that fence built .,Democratic
the opposition on this side is not against the fence  it is against emasculating all the laws of the land in order to get there .,Democratic
so i ask for an `` aye '' vote .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i submit for the record a memorandum of the congressional research service  dated february 7  2005  regarding the real id act .,Democratic
congressional research service  february 7  2005 .,Democratic
memorandum & lt ; br & gt ; to : house committee on homeland security  attention : sue ramanathan ; and house committee on the judiciary  attention : kristin wells .,Democratic
pursuant to your request on february 3  this memorandum analyzes section 102 of h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act .,Democratic
section 102  captioned `` waiver of laws necessary for improvement of barriers at borders  '' provides the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive all laws he deems necessary for the expeditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed by 102 of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) ( p.l .,Democratic
104-208  div .,Democratic
c  codified at 8 u.s.c .,Democratic
1103 note ) and removes judicial review from such waiver decisions .,Democratic
specifically  this memorandum discusses the extent to which congress has passed laws that provide waivers comparable to 102 of h.r.,Democratic
418 and outlines some of the legal issues that could potentially arise if 102 h.r.,Democratic
418  102 section 102 of h.r.,Democratic
418 would amend 102 ( c ) of iirira to read as follows : ( c ) waiver.,Democratic
-- ( 1 ) in general.,Democratic
-- notwithstanding any other provision of law  the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive  and shall waive  all laws such secretary  in such secretary 's sole discretion  determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section .,Democratic
( 2 ) no judicial review.,Democratic
-- notwithstanding any other provision of law ( statutory or nonstatutory )  no court shall have jurisdiction -- ( a ) to hear any cause or claim arising from any action undertaken  or any decision made  by the secretary of homeland security pursuant to paragraph ( 1 ) ; or ( b ) to order compensatory  declaratory  injunctive  equitable  or any other relief for damage alleged to arise from any such action or decision .,Democratic
waiver provisions if enacted  the new 102 would provide the secretary of homeland security with not only the authority to waive all laws he determines necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under 102 of iirira  but the requirement that the secretary do so .,Democratic
this provision could provide the secretary with broader waiver authority than what is currently in 102 ( c ) of iirira .,Democratic
this authority would apparently include laws other than the endangered species act and the national environmental policy act  but may not include a waiver of protections established in the constitution .,Democratic
all laws waived  however  must be determined by the secretary to be necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads .,Democratic
the waiver authority congress commonly waives preexisting laws  though the process necessary to complete the waiver and the number of laws waived vary considerably from provision to provision .,Democratic
even more common is the use of the phrase  `` notwithstanding any other provision of law.,Democratic
'' while the use of a broad `` notwithstanding any other provision of law '' infrequently governs interpretation  such directives seem facially preclusive  and some courts have determined that `` notwithstanding '' language may serve to explicitly preempt the application of other laws .,Democratic
other courts  however  have held that such provisions are generally not dispositive in determining the preemptive effect of a statute .,Democratic
after a review of federal law  primarily through electronic database searches and consultations with various crs experts  we were unable to locate a waiver provision identical to that of 102 of h.r.,Democratic
418 -- i.e.  a provision that contains `` notwithstanding language  '' provides a secretary of an executive agency the authority to waive all laws such secretary determines necessary  and directs the secretary to waive such laws .,Democratic
much more common  it appears  are waiver provisions that ( 1 ) exempt an action from other requirements contained in the act that authorizes the action  ( 2 ) specifically delineate the laws to be waived  or ( 3 ) waive a grouping of similar laws .,Democratic
the most analogous provisions that we located appear to be  at least on their face  the following : 43 u.s.c .,Democratic
1652 ( c ) : allows the secretary of the interior and other federal officers and agencies the authority to waive any procedural requirements of law or regulation which they deem desirable for authorizations that are necessary for or related to the construction  operation  and maintenance of the trans-alaska oil pipeline system ( e.g.  rights-of-way  permits  and leases ) .,Democratic
25 u.s.c .,Democratic
3406 : allows the secretaries of the interior  labor  health and human services  and education  notwithstanding any other law  to waive any statutory requirement  regulation  policy  or procedure promulgated by their agency that is identified by a tribal government as necessary to implement a submitted tribal plan under the indian employment  training and related services demonstration act of 1992  as amended .,Democratic
20 u.s.c .,Democratic
7426 : provides almost identical waiver language to that of 25 u.s.c .,Democratic
3406  but for plans submitted by tribal governments for the integration of education and related services provided to indian students .,Democratic
there are many other provisions that arguably grant broad waiver authority similar to that of 102  but contain qualifications or reporting requirements that seem to limit their breadth .,Democratic
for example  43 u.s.c .,Democratic
2008 allows the president to waive provisions of federal law he deems necessary in the national interest to facilitate the construction or operation of crude oil transportation systems  but such waivers must be submitted to congress  and congress must pass a joint resolution before the president can act on the waivers .,Democratic
as mentioned above and as the examples we have set forth arguably demonstrate  the breadth of waiver authority granted by 102 of h.r.,Democratic
418 does not appear to be common in the federal law searched .,Democratic
judicial review provisions by including the language `` no court  '' 102 ( c ) ( 2 ) of h.r.,Democratic
418 appears to preclude judicial review of a secretary 's decision to waive provisions of law by both federal and state courts .,Democratic
the preclusion of judicial review in state court and of state claims appears buttressed by the fact that 102 ( c ) is explicitly intended to preclude judicial review of nonstatutory laws -- a term which would seem to imply the inclusion of state constitutional and common law claims .,Democratic
it is generally accepted that article iii of the united states constitution grants congress the authority to regulate the jurisdiction  procedures  and remedies available in federal courts .,Democratic
however  what remains uncertain is whether congress 's authority  pursuant to article iii  extends to with respect to congress 's ability to control the jurisdiction of state courts  the supreme court has ruled that subject to a congressional provision to the contrary  state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all the classes of cases and controversies enumerated in article iii  except for suits between states  suits in which either the united states or a foreign state is a party  and those considered within the traditional jurisdiction of admiralty law .,Democratic
thus  it appears possible to argue that congress has a plenary power to allocate jurisdiction between the state and federal courts .,Democratic
in other words  if  for example  congress can make jurisdiction over an area of law exclusively federal  thereby depriving state courts of any ability to hear the claim  it appears that congress may also be able to remove a cause of action from state courts without concurrently granting jurisdiction to the federal courts .,Democratic
state courts  however  are often considered to be independent and autonomous from the federal court system .,Democratic
this independent status has led some scholars to argue that because the constitution appears to reserve to the states the authority to control the jurisdiction of their own courts  congress 's `` only means of allocating jurisdiction is through control of the federal court 's jurisdiction.,Democratic
'' the argument that state courts are autonomous can be derived  in part  from the supreme court 's doctrine with respect to its ability to review decisions from turning to congress 's ability to remove jurisdiction with respect to claims arising under the constitution  it appears that supreme court precedent requires that at least some forum be provided for the redress of constitutional rights .,Democratic
while it appears that the supreme court has not directly addressed whether there needs to be a judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights  it appears that the court has taken to noting constitutional reservations about legislative denials for jurisdiction for judicial review of constitutional issues  as well as construction of statutes that purport to limit the court 's jurisdiction .,Democratic
at least one justice  however  has indicated that there have been particular cases  such as political question cases  where all constitutional review is in effect precluded .,Democratic
nevertheless  the court has generally found a requirement that effective judicial remedies be present .,Democratic
for example  in cases involving particular rights  such as the availability of effective remedies for fifth amendment takings  the court has held that `` the compensation remedy is required by the constitution.,Democratic
'' in addition  lower federal courts appear to have held that  in most cases  some forum must be provided for the vindication of constitutional rights .,Democratic
cases such as these would seem to provide a basis for the court to find that parties seeking to vindicate other particular rights must have a judicial forum for such challenges ; therefore  the court may construe the provisions of h.r.,Democratic
418 in a manner that preserves this right .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from texas for yielding me this time .,Democratic
i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994  they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states  and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting `` no '' on consideration of this rule  which waives the unfunded mandate requirement .,Democratic
the majority may  if they have not already  attempt to argue that it is a minor mandate and show new and improved cbo estimates showing that the cost of this bill is only $ 125 million over the next 5 years ; and  therefore  i think this warrants at minimum committee hearings in markups that has so far been denied this congress .,Democratic
so we are not asking a lot this afternoon .,Democratic
and i am impressed by the governors association .,Democratic
their letter points out that while they commend the gentleman from michigan ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
tom davis ) for their commitment to driver 's license integrity  they find that those bills would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states  many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government .,Democratic
moreover  the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses issued by the states represents a massive unfunded mandate .,Democratic
so they close by urging us to allow the provisions of the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work .,Democratic
so i commend the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 for making such a very timely and important point of order  and i support her in it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
this amendment is simple and straightforward .,Democratic
it strikes section 102  which is entitled the `` waiver of laws necessary for the improvement of barriers and borders '' from the bill .,Democratic
i think the provision is trying to fix a process that is not broken .,Democratic
i offer this amendment to strike section 102  not to stop construction of the remaining 3 miles of the border fence  but to preserve the rule of law that this country was founded on .,Democratic
i want my colleagues to listen .,Democratic
i want to make this very clear .,Democratic
the breadth of this provision is unprecedented .,Democratic
the border fence in san diego is under construction right now .,Democratic
of the 14 miles authorized to be constructed  more than 9 miles of triple fence have been completed .,Democratic
only two sections have not been finished .,Democratic
in order to finish the fence  the customs and border patrol has proposed to fill a canyon known as smugglers gulch with over 2 million cubic yards of dirt .,Democratic
the triple fence would then be extended across the filled gulch .,Democratic
in february 2004  the coastal commission of california determined that the customs and border patrol had not demonstrated  among other things  that the project was consistent to `` maximize '' to the extent practicable with the policies of the california coastal management program  the state program approved under the federal coastal zone management act .,Democratic
the coastal zone management act requires federal agency activity within and outside the coastal zone that affects any land use  water or other natural resources in the coastal zone to be carried out in a manner that is consistent  to the maximum extent practicable  with the policies of an approved state management program .,Democratic
however  as stringent as these requirements are  if a federal court finds a federal activity to be inconsistent with an improved state program  the secretary determines that the compliance is unlikely to be achieved through mediation  the president may exempt from compliance the activity if the president determines that the activity is in the paramount interest of the united states .,Democratic
all the authority needed to build the barrier fence already exists in law .,Democratic
we can use laws and process that we have to get this fence built .,Democratic
there is no need for a blanket waiver to get any barrier constructed .,Democratic
on october 26 of 2004 the coastal commission staff met with the customs and border patrol/homeland security .,Democratic
in that meeting the customs and border patrol explained why they did not believe additional comments  other than those that had already been agreed upon  were necessary to bring the project into compliance with the applicable coastal policies .,Democratic
customs and border patrol maintained that it still wanted to continue to work with the coastal commission on measures they had agreed to  and the coastal commission indicated their continued willingness to work with them  despite the overall disagreement with some of the project components such as the smugglers gulch fill .,Democratic
coastal commission informed customs that in order to complete the federal consistency review process  they would have to write a letter outlining their position .,Democratic
however  the coastal commission has not received any letter .,Democratic
so why are we trying to fix something that is working through the established process of law ?,Democratic
i ask because the reach of this amendment is actually the border fence in san diego .,Democratic
the proposed section 102 gives an unprecedented waiver and power to the secretary of homeland security  not only for the border fence in san diego but for any  any area .,Democratic
if enacted  the new 102 section would provide the secretary of homeland security not only with the authority to waive all laws he determines necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of barriers and roads  but the requirement that the secretary do so .,Democratic
as i mentioned  there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance .,Democratic
current law allows the dhs secretary to waive the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act at the barrier  and this same provision was allowed to the attorney general prior to the creation of the department of homeland security .,Democratic
this provision has never  to date  been used in san diego nor am i aware at any other time the authority has been used on the barrier fence .,Democratic
so the remedies are there ; they are in the law .,Democratic
we forget in this debate that mexico is the number one trading partner of california .,Democratic
it is the busiest border in the world for the legitimate transfer of people and commerce  and it is in the city and county of san diego  and neither of those jurisdictions has asked for this draconian waiver .,Democratic
neither has the state of california .,Democratic
why would the government of the united states of america  at a time when we are advocating the support and enforcement of law  why would the government now want to forbid the use of our own law to finish the fence ?,Democratic
not even the importance of securing the border can justify placing a government official above the law .,Democratic
as i mentioned  my colleagues ought to be wary of what is proposed here .,Democratic
it grants authority to waive all laws notwithstanding any other provision of the law .,Democratic
this section also says  notwithstanding any other provision of the law  no court shall have jurisdiction to hear a claim  to order any relief .,Democratic
how can we celebrate elections in iraq and the honor of law when we in congress are now asking that we waive all laws ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 and i urge my colleagues to do the same .,Democratic
this bill is a misguided attempt to implement immigration reform under the guise of homeland security .,Democratic
this bill turns its back on a core principle that distinguishes america from other nations ; that of being a safe haven for the tired  poor  and weak .,Democratic
the three specific policies that the bill addresses -- the border fence  asylum provisions and driver 's licenses standards -- should have been vetted through the committee process .,Democratic
instead  this legislation has been rushed through the process -- without hearings  without debate  and with very little input from the minority side of the aisle .,Democratic
this bill is being debated simply for politics instead of going through a legitimate legislative process  a fact that should be of concern to every member  republican and democrat alike .,Democratic
today i will offer an amendment .,Democratic
my amendment is simple and straight forward .,Democratic
it strikes section 102 from the `` real id act of 2005 '' .,Democratic
the proposed provision is trying to fix a process that is n't broken .,Democratic
section 102 gives an unprecedented waiver and power to the secretary of homeland security .,Democratic
if passed  the secretary has the sole discretion to wave all laws in order to expedite the construction of barriers and roads .,Democratic
there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance .,Democratic
current law already allows the dhs secretary to waive the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act for the fence construction  the same exemption authorization that was allowed the attorney general prior to creation of dhs .,Democratic
i look forward to the debate on my amendment .,Democratic
as i stated before  h.r.,Democratic
418 is not a good bill and even more troubling is that we had no hearings or committee debate on it .,Democratic
we need frank and productive dialogue about the state of our immigration system and this bill does nothing to open up the discussion that this country needs to have .,Democratic
i do not support illegal immigration  but i do support the people who have come to our country and played by the rules in order to obtain their citizenship status .,Democratic
not only do we have a responsibility and a proud history of protecting those who seek asylum in our country  which this bill is trying to thwart  we have a responsibility to legal immigrants who are contributing to our society to reduce the lengthy backlog to citizenship .,Democratic
just earlier this week in meeting with some bureau of citizenship and immigration services employees  i was not surprised to learn that workers who were hired to help eliminate the backlog four years ago have been asked to stay on for another year .,Democratic
i do not often hear of temporary employees that are necessary for five years .,Democratic
i also the effects of the real id act are not only bad for domestic politics  they are destructive for the peace process in the middle east .,Democratic
the act states : `` an alien who is an officer  official  representative  or spokesman of the palestine liberation organization is considered  for purposes of this act  to be engaged in a terrorist activity.,Democratic
'' in the first place  the united states already has a formal  congressionally approved mechanism for designating foreign terrorist organizations and imposing sanctions on them .,Democratic
the plo is not on the u.s. list of foreign terrorist organizations .,Democratic
this sneaky  backdoor attempt to override the responsibility of the state department and the will of congress is an incredibly stupid way to execute u.s. diplomacy .,Democratic
second  we are now on the cusp of a historic moment in the middle east peace process .,Democratic
the administration has promised that they will be actively engaged in the middle east peace process .,Democratic
i find it hard to believe that they can be `` actively '' engaged in the peace process if the president will not be able to invite newly elected president mahmoud abbas to his texas ranch  camp david or any other location within the united states .,Democratic
president abbas appears to be making considerable efforts in brokering peace  and the united states should be supporting his efforts .,Democratic
the effects of this provision will be a diplomatic nightmare and damage the united states 's ability to be a fair broker in the peace process .,Democratic
this provision is an embarrassment to united states diplomacy -- it is highly counterproductive to peace negotiations .,Democratic
furthermore  i have concerns with the national driver 's license standards in this bill .,Democratic
current law already addresses this issue  but the regulations have been implemented since this bill was passed only 10 weeks ago .,Democratic
national driver 's license standards in this bill create an unfunded mandate for states .,Democratic
under this bill  at least 10 states would be forced to make significant changes to their systems  despite the fact that security standards can be attained without the interference this bill creates .,Democratic
state control of the licensing and identification process is crucial to maintaining public safety  bolstering security  reducing fraud  keeping costs of car insurance down and protecting privacy and federal standards for such documents should be limited to those enumerated in the intelligence reform act of 2004 .,Democratic
additionally  the proponents of this bill do not want you to know that h.r.,Democratic
418 would not have prevented 9/11 hijackers from obtaining a driver 's license or id .,Democratic
the breach of our security was a result of the hijackers having been issued legal visas to come to the united states  which many of them used to apply for driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
does h.r.,Democratic
418 seek to address the root of the problem here ?,Democratic
no  obviously not .,Democratic
again  this bill is political posturing under the guise of national security .,Democratic
instead of debating h.r.,Democratic
418  the house of representatives should be focused on ensuring the successful enactment of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 and working on comprehensively reforming our immigration system so that immigration is legal  safe  orderly  and reflective of the needs of american families  businesses  and national security .,Democratic
leadership should be ashamed to have brought a bill like this that will affect our environment  our citizens  and people from all around the world to the floor in such a manner .,Democratic
i can not support the process nor the actual policy this bill proposes and i urge my colleagues vote no on h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
madam chairman  i know how reluctant the chairman is .,Democratic
this is a supplemental budget .,Democratic
by definition it goes beyond whatever we did in the previous year .,Democratic
that is why it is called a supplemental .,Democratic
and by some technical mumbo jumbo  he has managed to say that this supplemental is not subject to the rule that he just read .,Democratic
through technicalities  through arcane kinds of things  he is saying that the veterans of this nation are not entitled to this care because he is using a rule which is not being used for the $ 81 billion that we have on the floor but is used for this $ 3 billion that we are trying to use for our nation 's veterans .,Democratic
madam chairman  i understand these rules  and i understand these technical points of order .,Democratic
they are designed to protect certain amendments and not have others .,Democratic
fine .,Democratic
but when one uses that rule to shut out the veterans of this nation  to shut out the troops that are coming back from iraq and afghanistan  from the care that they deserve and will need  we are going to shut down ptsd programs  madam chairman  all across this nation  and yet every soldier and marine is going to come back with potentially that disorder .,Democratic
so one can use all the rules  but what we are doing here is immoral  it is unconscionable  it is outrageous that we would be treating the veterans in this way .,Democratic
madam chairman  i understand what the chairman is saying .,Democratic
i have been around here long enough .,Democratic
i do not have confidence in that regular order .,Democratic
i know what is going to happen then .,Democratic
then we will be accused of legislating on appropriations or some other rule will be brought up .,Democratic
so i do not accept the ruling .,Democratic
i intend to challenge the ruling  and i think we owe this to our veterans .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Democratic
i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
reyes ) xz4003370 for bringing us these two amendments .,Democratic
again  these are for national security emergency issues  border patrol agents at our border .,Democratic
i represent all the california-mexico border .,Democratic
i know that we need these agents .,Democratic
the president asked for them  and yet he did not put the money in to pay for them .,Democratic
in addition  every veterans group and the va itself say to complete the year  giving the services they need  they need another $ 1.3 billion .,Democratic
this is truly an emergency .,Democratic
the rules that will be used once again to say that our national defense at the border  our veterans to get their adequate health care  somehow we violate the rules  but let us not violate common sense .,Democratic
common sense says we need these funds .,Democratic
we need this protection .,Democratic
we need these services for our veterans .,Democratic
let us dispense with the technical objections and fund what we need for our veterans and for our border defense .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me reiterate what i said about nitpicking and arcane rules .,Democratic
this whole bill is a violation of the rules of the house except for the fact that it says in the bill it does not violate the rules .,Democratic
so telling us that we should have respect for the rules  my colleagues ought to show some respect for the good sense of the american people  for common sense .,Democratic
this whole bill is a violation of the rules without a waiver .,Democratic
is that not true  mr.,Democratic
chairman ?,Democratic
would this bill be a violation of the rules if there was not a waiver involved in the rules ?,Democratic
as i said  the rules are being used to damage common sense and to damage our nation 's security and damage our health care to our veterans .,Democratic
i think it is a disgrace to use those rules for these purposes .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i have an amendment which i am labeling an emergency amendment .,Democratic
it is an emergency amendment because the money is needed for the veterans of this nation  especially those who are returning from the war in iraq and afghanistan who may not be able to get the services they need for a variety of wounds  both physical and mental .,Democratic
let me first say where i got the number of $ 3.1 billion .,Democratic
it is not just a figure grabbed from the air .,Democratic
every year the veterans service organizations of this nation put together a budget called the independent budget for the department of veterans affairs .,Democratic
this is the one for 2006 .,Democratic
what it says is that just to keep meeting the needs for our current veterans and those who we expect to see in the coming year  we will need an additional $ 3.1 billion than was allocated by the president in his budget .,Democratic
we do not know what this house will adopt yet  so this figure is drawn from the inadequacies of the president 's budget as he gave it to congress recently .,Democratic
this is a supplemental budget for those fighting in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
at least that is the title .,Democratic
let me make sure all the people of the house understand the relevance of the veterans budget for the war that we are fighting abroad .,Democratic
here is what our first president  george washington  said and it has never been done more eloquently : `` the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.,Democratic
'' mr.,Democratic
chairman  the morale of our troops overseas depends on how we are going to treat their comrades when they return and how we treat their comrades who served in earlier battles .,Democratic
we are not treating them to the level that is worthy of their sacrifice .,Democratic
whether you look at the amount of nurses  whether you look at research funds  whether you look at the resources for post-traumatic stress disorder for which virtually every returning soldier  marine who is in iraq and afghanistan may have  wherever you look  there is a deficiency in this veterans budget .,Democratic
i call that an emergency .,Democratic
i call that important to the struggle that is being waged overseas .,Democratic
if you are voting for that struggle  you have to vote to make sure the veterans who come back from that struggle are well treated .,Democratic
right now we have a proposal from the president which advocates a mere one-half of 1 percent increase in the veterans health care budget over the previous year .,Democratic
that is a real cut  because of health inflation and the advancing age and the needs of the population  to about a 14 or 15 percent cut by the administration 's own figures .,Democratic
so we are cutting in real terms 15 percent from the veterans health care budget .,Democratic
how does the administration want to fund that cut ?,Democratic
doubling the copayments for prescription drugs  adding an enrollment fee of up to $ 250 for those in the so-called lower categories of veterans preference .,Democratic
that is outrageous .,Democratic
that is unconscionable to charge the veterans of this nation for their own health care and to balance the budget on the backs of these veterans .,Democratic
the chairman of the committee on veterans ' affairs was not satisfied with having a $ 250 enrollment fee .,Democratic
he proposed doubling it to almost $ 500 for some of these veterans .,Democratic
these veterans are supposedly in lower categories  either because of the nature of their illness or their income .,Democratic
but  madam chairman  this nation  this congress has the funds to help all of these veterans to get the care that they need .,Democratic
let me remind my colleagues  this is a $ 2.5 trillion budget that we are operating within our nation .,Democratic
we have about a $ 400 billion deficit  a $ 7.5 trillion debt .,Democratic
we are spending several billion dollars a week in iraq .,Democratic
yet someone is going to say that we do not have the $ 3 billion that is necessary for our veterans ?,Democratic
i reject that argument because this is a nation that is worthy of its veterans .,Democratic
this a nation that could put the money where it is needed .,Democratic
and this is a nation that can do what is required for our veterans .,Democratic
we simply can not charge these copayments .,Democratic
we simply can not charge this enrollment fee .,Democratic
we simply can not continue to have a va that is gagged from informing veterans of their rights under law .,Democratic
that is what is happening in the va today .,Democratic
my amendment to provide $ 3 billion extra will correct that injustice .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer an amendment .,Democratic
the clerk read as follows : amendment offered by mr.,Democratic

mr. chairman  in last year 's appropriation bill  that hospital was awarded close to $ 100 million for seismic refitting  retrofitting for earthquake safety .,Democratic
no  it is not .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time do i have remaining ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner ) and all of those on the republican side who are so concerned about my district .,Democratic
i represent the california border between mexico and the united states .,Democratic
this so-called fence that you want to put in my district is really a giant public works project that does enormous harm .,Democratic
i wish you were equally concerned about the 50 million gallons of sewage that flows into my district that we should be treating .,Democratic
i wish you were concerned about the legal border crossings  that take four or five hours some days .,Democratic
i wish you would be concerned about my local health facilities who treat the undocumented and refund those dollars .,Democratic
but  no  you want to put a public works project in that waives all existing environmental laws necessary to ensure the construction of roads  barriers  cut and fills  taking down mountains .,Democratic
this would result in an enormous waste of millions of federal and state dollars that have already been contributed to restore and protect this area in san diego  its historical  its cultural  its environmental resources .,Democratic
ironically  the united nations ramsar convention recently bestowed the prestigious label of `` wetlands of international importance '' on this 2  500-acre national wildlife refuge and state park that you are going to destroy .,Democratic
now  we know we have to have border security .,Democratic
we live right there .,Democratic
you think we want to be overrun with terrorists ?,Democratic
we know what it takes .,Democratic
we know what a smart border is .,Democratic
and what you are suggesting is not a smart border .,Democratic
for a minimal security benefit and maximum dollars spent  you will do irreparable damage to areas along the western portion of the u.s.-mexico border .,Democratic
this multitiered fence  road building  cut and fill  shaving down of mountains will destroy  as i said  an environmentally sensitive area  violate several sections of the coastal act and destroy acres of sensitive habitat and wetlands and coastline .,Democratic
this sensitive habitat plays a vital role in the sustainability of the binational ecosystem .,Democratic
vote down this bill .,Democratic

we have a major  major  major operation in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
the bill on the floor today appropriates a sum of $ 81 billion  and we will be spending over $ 200 billion .,Democratic
it seems to me that we ought to guarantee jobs to veterans with companies that are awarded government contracts from this fund .,Democratic
our active duty are fighting  but those who volunteer to go and help in other ways should have the preference that their veterans ' service offers .,Democratic
we have all rallied to support our troops  but often after they come home  our veterans are not treated with the respect they deserve .,Democratic
i outlined yesterday the lack of respect that they will have and continue to have because of lack of adequate funding in the health care system .,Democratic
ptsd  post-traumatic stress disorder  for example  will not have the funding that is needed to treat what is expected to arise out of the current war .,Democratic
as i said yesterday  research funds are being cut  nurses ' positions are being cut .,Democratic
i tried yesterday to put an amendment on the floor that would supplement this supplemental with an additional $ 3 billion that the veterans groups think and have testified and have outlined is necessary .,Democratic
that $ 3 billion was not added in yesterday 's supplemental .,Democratic
so today i ask that we ensure that there are jobs for our nation 's veterans  whether they are new or old .,Democratic
let us give them the preference that they have in law at home with the preference for the contracts that are being awarded with such abandon in the middle east today .,Democratic
we know  if we do not serve our veterans with jobs or health care  what occurs .,Democratic
we know that up to half of the homeless on the streets today are veterans  mainly from vietnam  because we did not give them the honor  the respect  the health care  the jobs  the housing that they needed .,Democratic
and so they are on the street after having fought for this country .,Democratic
one way to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else is to include veterans in the rebuilding of iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
many of them fought for freedom for those nations .,Democratic
let us get them involved in the effort to build the future .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i hope that the rules are not invoked here once again to stop a commonsense approach to helping our veterans in this nation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the gentleman asked me a question .,Democratic
including the va that says that we have enough money .,Democratic
mr. chairman  whatever the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) suggests  i would consider .,Democratic
the va says we do not have enough money ... ... .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i wish to be heard on the point of order .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if the gentleman would continue to yield  look  everybody wants efficiencies in this system ; but i will say  for a paralyzed veteran with a spinal cord injury  there is no better place than the va to get care .,Democratic
to keep that quality of care for those veterans requires investment in our system .,Democratic
we are all looking for efficiencies but i will tell you there is no independent person  including the va .,Democratic
mr. speaker  first we have to talk about the procedure .,Democratic
this is a complicated bill .,Democratic
it includes several different subjects  asylum  identification  a fence  yet apparently the majority is contemplating  at most  one amendment .,Democratic
this is legislation by hostage-taking .,Democratic
you put a whole bunch of things together  including several that are controversial  so if members oppose any one of them  they will be extorted into voting for the whole package .,Democratic
we are in the process now  after the election in iraq  of trying to persuade the shiia  who will be in the overwhelming majority  to practice democracy  not to abuse their majority  but in fact to encourage members of the minority to participate .,Democratic
it is essential for us to be able to salvage what is going on in iraq for there to be an agreement on the part of the sunni muslims to participate .,Democratic
in other words  we are telling the people of iraq that to practice democracy means respect for minority rights .,Democratic
and here we have the majority in the house of representatives  a fairly narrow majority  apparently contemplating forcing an up-or-down vote on controversial legislation  maybe allowing one amendment  clearly repressing the strong desire of the minority to be able fully to debate it .,Democratic
in the end  the majority will decide  but they do n't even want the debate .,Democratic
and i guess i know  mr.,Democratic
speaker  it is a violation to address the tv audience  and i will not do so .,Democratic
but i will express the hope that if there are any members of the iraqi provisional assembly watching this  they understand the message that is very important .,Democratic
please do not try this at home .,Democratic
do not  in the iraqi assembly  show disrespect for the rights of the minority .,Democratic
that is the hallmark of this outrageous procedure .,Democratic
and why are we doing it ?,Democratic
it is 1 : 35 on wednesday .,Democratic
we are going to finish this debate  general debate and have the rest of the day to do nothing  tomorrow then maybe debate one or two amendments .,Democratic
there is no reason why .,Democratic
you know what ?,Democratic
what about an open rule ?,Democratic
what about democracy ?,Democratic
what about bringing a complicated bill to the floor and letting members offer amendments and the majority will win .,Democratic
you are not afraid  apparently  of losing the vote .,Democratic
you are afraid of losing the argument .,Democratic
and i understand why .,Democratic
let me talk now about asylum .,Democratic
this congress created the united states commission on international religious freedom in 1998 .,Democratic
that commission just issued a very lengthy report  very critical of the inhumane aspects of our asylum operation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i include for the record the article from the new york times  documenting that report at this point .,Democratic
asylum seekers treated poorly  u.s. panel says thousands of people who come to the united states saying they are seeking refuge from persecution are treated like criminals while their claims are evaluated -- strip-searched  shackled and often thrown into solitary confinement in local jails and federal detention centers -- a bipartisan federal commission found in a report to be released today .,Democratic
the report  by the united states commission on international religious freedom  an agency created by congress in 1998  describes an ad hoc system run by the department of homeland security that has extreme disparities in who is released or granted asylum  depending on whether someone seeks refuge in texas or new york  comes from iraq or haiti  or is represented by a lawyer .,Democratic
the new york metropolitan region ranks among the harshest in terms of the conditions of detention centers  with constant surveillance  stark quarters and degrading treatment .,Democratic
those awaiting a court decision on asylum are also less likely to be freed .,Democratic
for example  3.8 percent of asylum seekers were freed from the detention center in elizabeth  n.j.  compared with 94 percent in san antonio .,Democratic
there were 8.4 percent released from the detention center in queens  while in chicago 81 percent were let go .,Democratic
one of the experts who examined the centers for the commission  craig haney  a psychologist who briefed the senate judiciary committee on the subject yesterday  said he was shocked by what he found .,Democratic
`` i was taken aback by the severity of conditions  the severity of deprivations and  frankly  the expense  '' he said in an interview .,Democratic
he said that one of 19 centers examined handled asylum seekers differently from criminals -- in broward county  fla.,Democratic
 where many seeking refuge are from cuba and where former cuban refugees form a potent political force .,Democratic
at $ 83 a day  the florida center costs less than half the $ 200 per detainee of the queens detention center  though both are run by the same company .,Democratic
the report said that women and children seeking asylum  `` whose trauma histories and emotional needs may be more severe and require more specialized training  '' were at greater risk of harm .,Democratic
among other recommendations  the commission urged that a high-level protector of refugees be appointed to monitor the system and correct inequities .,Democratic
manny van pelt  a spokesman for immigration and customs enforcement  an agency within homeland security that oversees the detention of asylum seekers  defended the system .,Democratic
`` we have a robust inspections program that conducts audits of our detention facilities nationwide  and our detention facilities are accredited and subjected to regular inspection by the u.n .,Democratic
high commission for refugees  '' he said in an interview .,Democratic
`` they are clean and they are safe environments .,Democratic
even better  the detention system protects the public.,Democratic
'' the commission had been asked by congress to examine the effectiveness of the nation 's asylum regulations  created in part as a response to the 1993 world trade center bombings  in an effort to balance the country 's desire to shelter those suffering from persecution abroad with its need to keep out criminals and terrorists .,Democratic
the system  known as expedited removal  requires those seeking asylum at airports and borders to be sent back immediately unless they are found to have a `` credible fear '' of persecution when questioned by immigration officers .,Democratic
those who pass the test -- a vast majority -- are then detained until an immigration judge decides the validity of their claim .,Democratic
unless they are released pending a decision  the average detainee is held for 64 days and a third stay more than 90 days -- some even years  the report found .,Democratic
the number of asylum seekers  and the rate at which they are freed  have both dropped sharply since the terrorist attacks of 2001  the study showed .,Democratic
but rates of asylum also differed sharply by national groups between 2000 and 2004  with more than 80 percent of cubans given a permanent right to stay  along with more than 60 percent of iraqis .,Democratic
by contrast  just more than 10 percent of those from haiti and fewer than 5 percent of those from ei salvador were granted asylum .,Democratic
detainees represented by lawyers were up to 30 times more likely to gain asylum  but in some places fewer than half the detainees had lawyers .,Democratic
with the exception of the operation at george bush intercontinental airport in houston  the report found that asylum seekers were not pressed to withdraw their asylum claims before the interview  nor were claims summarily denied .,Democratic
but it found that judges often wrongly used airport statements to deny asylum later .,Democratic
before the change in the law  only asylum seekers with criminal records were detained .,Democratic
now  nearly all are locked up with ordinary criminals .,Democratic
in 2003  5  585 men and 1  015 women seeking asylum were jailed .,Democratic
to cut down on that number  the commission recommended that the airport interviewers  and not just immigration judges  be given the authority to grant asylum on the spot when warranted .,Democratic
severe psychological damage is among the effects of throwing people seeking refuge together with criminals in `` stark conditions  '' the report said  describing 24-hour lights  chained walks to go eat  no privacy even to use the toilet and little chance to exercise outdoors .,Democratic
detainees are allowed to work but paid $ 1 a day .,Democratic
five of the 19 detention centers examined had mental health staff  and none had guards trained to work with victims of torture or repression .,Democratic
in most places the treatment for those considered suicidal was solitary confinement .,Democratic
a footnote pointed out that isolation was `` likely to exacerbate depression  '' not prevent suicide .,Democratic
`` the whole detention system is there to break you down further  '' one former detainee told interviewers in the report .,Democratic
`` you are not even allowed to cry .,Democratic
if you do  they take you to isolation.,Democratic
'' cut off from the outside world and not allowed incoming calls  even from a lawyer  the detainees are at high risk for depression  the commission said  and some even said they gave up their quest for asylum because of the unbearable conditions .,Democratic
since the 1996 change in immigration law  critics have complained that the system is subjecting those fleeing torture and repression to harsh conditions in detention that can drag on for years .,Democratic
but this is the first bipartisan examination based on an inside view .,Democratic
one of the republican commission members  michael k. young  the president of the university of utah and an adviser to president george h. w. bush  said great pains were taken to make the two-year effort politically balanced .,Democratic
`` that is one of the things that gives this report real strength  '' he said .,Democratic
preeta d. bansal  a democrat who chaired the commission  said more research is needed  especially on the reasons for the sharp drop in asylum seekers .,Democratic
`` we have been told that in foreign countries the department of homeland security is being employed to prevent people from even getting on board airplanes  '' said ms.,Democratic
bansal  a former solicitor general of new york state .,Democratic
`` we think further follow-up needs to be done.,Democratic
'' the report comes the same week that asylum legislation is to be introduced in the house by representative f. james sensenbrenner jr.  a wisconsin republican and chairman of the judiciary committee .,Democratic
among other visions  the bill  known as the real id act  would make it harder for refugees to get asylum .,Democratic
so we have a bipartisan committee on international religious freedom critical of our denial of asylum rights .,Democratic
and what is the response of the majority ?,Democratic
let us make a bad situation worse .,Democratic
mr. speaker  why not an open amendment procedure so those of us who have paid attention to this report could offer amendments that embody it ?,Democratic
why will we not be allowed to offer amendments from this interreligious commission  and it is an interreligious commission .,Democratic
i know one of the problems the majority has  and i sympathize  but apparently somebody has bowdlerized their bibles .,Democratic
and i sympathize ; these are people who have bibles  but their bibles have big things missing .,Democratic
for example  we often hear leviticus quoted on the floor of the house .,Democratic
leviticus 19  chapters 33 and 34  `` when an alien lives with you in your land  do not mistreat him .,Democratic
the alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born .,Democratic
love him as yourself  for you were aliens in egypt.,Democratic
'' now  that is in leviticus .,Democratic
i know leviticus gets turned on and off here like an electric bulb  but it does now seem to me that kind of cafeteria approach to religion is something the majority has adopted .,Democratic
here we have it in leviticus .,Democratic
this is undoubtedly why the catholic bishops have spoken out against this bill and have asked some of us to oppose it .,Democratic
but again  religion is to be invoked selectively so religious values are for another time  not when there is political hay to be made by taking this popular stance .,Democratic
what we have is an undemocratic procedure being mobilized to suppress  even debate  and an opportunity to consider the report of this commission in the service of a doctrine which would seem to me to violate some fundamental religious principles .,Democratic
i guess the majority has the votes to do that if they want to  but they have a day to reconsider  and i hope perhaps something will change their minds .,Democratic
once again we are using the rules to block a commonsense amendment .,Democratic
it seems to me that the chairman has deeper issues than a blocking of the thing on a procedural ground and feels that the va is not doing its job .,Democratic
that is obviously a deep issue that we ought to discuss  but that should not lead him to block this amendment .,Democratic
in addition  the only way i could judge the sincerity of the majority party in these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman of the committee i have sat on for the last 12 years ; that is  the va committee .,Democratic
the chairman was removed from that job  purged from that job because he stood up for veterans .,Democratic
i hope  mr.,Democratic
chairman  that the gentleman will join me on a mission as i join him on a mission for accountability and efficiency to convince the leadership of his party to put back on that committee members of the committee who actually fight for veterans .,Democratic
once again  i think the veterans of this nation ought to understand that the rules of this house can be waived for anything that the majority party wants  but when it comes to the veterans of this nation  they refuse to waive the rules .,Democratic
mr. speaker  does the gentleman really believe that 20 minutes of debate  10 on each side  on these complicated issues  is free and flowing debate ?,Democratic
we got out early yesterday ; we are here today .,Democratic
why only 10 minutes of debate on each side on these complicated issues ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  hearing the chairman of the committee on rules describe this restricted rule as fair and balanced reinforces the fact that when people on the right in america politically tell you something is fair and balanced  you had better ask for another deck of cards .,Democratic
the rule not only limits the amendments ; and it makes sense  the chairman 's defense makes sense if you start from the perspective that no amendments ought to be allowed .,Democratic
and then when you let in two out of 10  or two out of six  somehow you have been generous .,Democratic
ought not the assumption be in favor of openness  especially since the house has not been doing very much ?,Democratic
then the chairman said  well  we do not have to have long debate on these things ; after all  we had a hearing in the committee on rules  and it was streamed on line .,Democratic
anyone who thinks that a hearing in the committee on rules that is streamed on line is a substitute for open and free debate in the united states house of representatives  or anyone who says that  ought to remember  i would give just one piece of advice .,Democratic
no matter how pressed one feels in a debate  try to avoid saying something that no one is going to believe .,Democratic
it really does not help your cause .,Democratic
no one thinks that an online hearing in the committee on rules with a handful of members in a room that has 30 seats substitutes for free and open debate in the house of representatives  and particularly when you only give 10 minutes on a particular amendment .,Democratic
i want to talk about the amendment on asylum .,Democratic
we heard a lot of discussion last year in the election from people complaining that religion had been driven from the public square .,Democratic
well  guess who is ignoring religion this year ?,Democratic
the majority .,Democratic
the provisions on asylum have evoked overwhelming opposition from the various religious communities in america .,Democratic
i noted yesterday that the commission on interreligious freedom set up by this congress to protect religious freedom in the world put out earlier this week a report saying that our asylum procedures are too restrictive .,Democratic
and what is the response of the majority ?,Democratic
to make what the commission on interreligious freedom says is a bad situation much worse .,Democratic
i noted yesterday  in leviticus it says  and i have looked at various translations  various renderings  and in every one it sometimes says `` stranger  '' it sometimes says `` alien.,Democratic
'' it is clear it means people we would describe as immigrants .,Democratic
it says  treat them as you would treat the native born .,Democratic
now  i do not purport to be a religious scholar .,Democratic
i do not purport to be an expert in religious interpretation  but i am puzzled .,Democratic
can we turn leviticus on and off that way ?,Democratic
i mean  often i have heard leviticus quoted as justification for measures that are critical of homosexuals .,Democratic
do you not have to take it as a package ?,Democratic
i mean  if you are going to use leviticus to disadvantage homosexuals  do you not have to use it to be nice to immigrants ?,Democratic
is it not true that what is leviticus for the goose is leviticus for the gander ?,Democratic
again  i acknowledge i am not a theological expert  so i will turn to some who are .,Democratic
i got a copy yesterday from the interfaith statement .,Democratic
`` the real id act  '' it says  `` threatens the ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states  '' signed by a variety of jewish and catholic and protestant groups  the jesuit religious service  the episcopal migration ministries  the church world service  the jubilee campaign  the lutheran immigration and refugee service .,Democratic
mr. speaker  because i do not think that religion ought to be driven from the public square on an issue on which there is such an overwhelming religious consensus  i will offer a statement condemning this bill and its asylum provisions be inserted here .,Democratic
real id act threatens ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states as representatives of various faith traditions  we are deeply concerned that the real id act  legislation proposed by representative jim sensenbrenner ( r-wi )  would make asylum a more remote possibility for hundreds of persons who need protection .,Democratic
we understand that safeguarding our national security is an urgent issue  and we support measures that honor that concern .,Democratic
we also subscribe to core beliefs which require that we provide safety to victims of persecution  particularly those who have no recourse to the projection that democratic societies traditionally provide .,Democratic
restricting access to asylum beyond current practice and does not serve the cause of national security and  moreover  erodes a sacred and legal responsibility to give safety to those whose only protection comes from asylum .,Democratic
each of our traditions has witnessed the suffering of persons whose beliefs often place them in jeopardy and possibly in mortal danger .,Democratic
as american-based faith communities  we have cherished the ability of asylum seekers to find safety in communities around our nation .,Democratic
we are  therefore  saddened by a further erosion of our asylum system under the pretext of national security .,Democratic
we urge members of congress to reject the notion that all asylees are prospective terrorists and that the current system needs to be made more restrictive .,Democratic
the belief that we must receive persons who have been rejected and persecuted because of their ideas and religious practices is anchored in both our histories and sacred texts .,Democratic
we have contributed over the years to supporting and enriching practices which embrace hospitality as not only a religious but an american value .,Democratic
we also appreciate the need to prevent terrorism from violating both our freedom and safety .,Democratic
we believe that hospitality to the stranger -- particularly one who has been persecuted -- and security are compatible national goals .,Democratic
we  therefore  reject legislation that subverts hospitality in the name of security .,Democratic
the current asylum system includes rigorous safeguards against terrorists abusing the asylum system .,Democratic
the changes proposed by the real id act raise a false issue in further victimizing legitimate asylum seekers .,Democratic
requiring unreasonable levels of evidence to prove an asylum claim  placing a greater burden on asylum seekers to convince reviewers of the key motivation of their accusers  and allowing subjective considerations to guide the review process all send a chilling message to those who desperately seek the safety and protection which they have a right to expect of our great nation .,Democratic
we have all seen how fear can pervert justice .,Democratic
we believe that the religious traditions which we embrace calls us to oppose a narrowing of the door to asylum by some of the world 's most at-risk persons .,Democratic
we are committed to resisting a fear driven agenda which violates our faith-based principles .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the asylum provisions make it much harder for people to get asylum .,Democratic
we will have 20 minutes to debate this issue .,Democratic
it would take me half of that time to read the full list of signers .,Democratic
last week  we were visited  those of us on the democratic side  by a representative of the catholic bishops  who asked us specifically to oppose this bill and particularly to condemn the asylum provisions .,Democratic
i do not think there has been any showing that asylumees have been terrorists .,Democratic
but  in any case  i do want to stress  those of you who have said we have insufficiently paid attention to religious values  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i urge them not to turn their back on the religious community now and not to give the religious communities  a broad range of them  10 minutes in which we can make the case that this bill violates biblical injunctions about aliens and undercuts our mission to be a haven for the religiously persecuted .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
the first thing is america will not sleep any more securely with the passage of this piece of legislation  as well intended as it may be  because i am not going to question the motives of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle .,Democratic
but why do a useless thing ?,Democratic
why would the state legislatures  why would the state governors  why would every latino advocacy group come against this ?,Democratic
why would the national council of bishops here in the states come out against this ?,Democratic
it is for various reasons .,Democratic
but they all acknowledge that there is not a conspiracy going on here to thwart the efforts at security by these groups .,Democratic
no one would accuse these individuals of that  because this does not do anything .,Democratic
it only burdens the state and does not get us anywhere .,Democratic
but more importantly  and i really believe this  this is an anti-immigrant bill in the guise of some sort of security consideration  which it does not further .,Democratic
and so we ask  who are these immigrants ?,Democratic
i have a simple answer for all of us .,Democratic
look in the mirror .,Democratic
that is who we are talking about .,Democratic
we all got here one way or another  some earlier than others .,Democratic
we are all immigrants .,Democratic
what this bill is really about is not bad people coming into this country to do bad things to this country .,Democratic
it is about preventing good people coming into this country to do good things .,Democratic
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
the proponents of this dangerous and divisive bill have mischaracterized and misrepresented it as a measure that focuses on national security .,Democratic
this could not be further from the truth .,Democratic
i would urge my colleagues today to listen beyond the harsh rhetoric and to closely examine this legislation .,Democratic
because further study will reveal that h.r.,Democratic
418 is really nothing more than a bill designed to bash immigrants and punish refugees .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 ignores our nation 's proud history of protecting those fleeing brutal human rights abuses  torture and persecution .,Democratic
it would force our country to turn its back on women  children  and victims of religious persecution .,Democratic
the bill would create insurmountable hurdles for legitimate asylum-seekers and slam the door shut on refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses .,Democratic
that is not america .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 also ignores the reality that there are an estimated 10 million or more undocumented immigrants living in our country .,Democratic
this bill would do nothing to prevent undocumented migration to the united states .,Democratic
if anything  this bill will only further compound the flaws in our nation 's immigrations laws .,Democratic
and it would make the job of protecting our homeland even more challenging .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 will make the vital job of law enforcement to arrest criminals and root out potential terrorists almost impossible .,Democratic
in short  immigration enforcement will continue to expend their valuable  but limited  resources and energy in pursuing hardworking busboys and nannies  instead of bad actors who mean us real harm .,Democratic
immigration officers represent our frontline forces in protecting our homeland .,Democratic
let 's not make their jobs even more demanding .,Democratic
let 's give them the policies  the resources and the tools they need to succeed .,Democratic
mr. chairman  imagine your neighbors  the families who live across the street  the men and women who join us at church -- all of the hard working people who share the roads with us .,Democratic
now imagine these hundreds of thousands  perhaps millions of people  driving without a license  without car insurance or registration .,Democratic
such a policy will wreak havoc on our streets and highways .,Democratic
it also will do nothing to address our broken immigration system .,Democratic
it will just force hard working people further into the shadows and create an increased demand for the black market of fake identity documents .,Democratic
i agree that congress must examine how to improve enforcement of immigration law  but we first must create laws that are enforceable and in step with reality .,Democratic
let me close by saying this .,Democratic
i am not alone in my strong opposition to this misguided and mean-spirited legislation .,Democratic
also opposing the bill are the national governor 's association  the national council of state legislatures  many other national  state and local organizations  security and immigration policy experts  immigration attorneys  more than 100 religious organizations  hispanic and asian organizations  the u.n .,Democratic
commissioner for refugees  the afl-cio  the service employees international union and other labor unions .,Democratic
the list goes on and on  and i consider myself very good company .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill .,Democratic
the only thing `` real '' about the real id act is that it is real bad for america .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank my colleague who ably serves on the permanent select committee on intelligence  as well as the committee on rules  for the time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  as the lead conferee on the intelligence reform bill  i oppose the rule on h.r.,Democratic
418 and the underlying bill because they will not make us safer .,Democratic
what h.r.,Democratic
418 will do is undermine several key provisions of the bipartisan intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act  which congress passed and the president signed into law just 2 months ago .,Democratic
those who claim that the so-called real id act will enhance national security are flat wrong .,Democratic
remember  all of the september 11 hijackers entered this country with legal immigration documents .,Democratic
legislation prohibiting illegal immigrants from obtaining driver 's licenses would not have stopped a single 9/11 hijacker .,Democratic
we dealt with this issue responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation .,Democratic
the law establishes tough minimum federal standards for driver 's licenses so that all driver 's licenses have certain key security features .,Democratic
the law also requires the transportation security administration to set newer standards within 6 months for identification documents which may be used to board commercial airplanes .,Democratic
these provisions are much stronger than what is being proposed by h.r.,Democratic
418  yet h.r.,Democratic
418 would repeal these critical new security upgrades .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i wholeheartedly agree that if we want to cut down on illegal immigration  we must improve border security .,Democratic
just 2 weeks ago  an astute crane operator at the port of los angeles discovered 32 chinese stowaways in a container that had just been unloaded from a panamanian freighter .,Democratic
the state of california already prohibits illegal immigrants from getting a driver 's license  but that did not discourage these stowaways from trying to sneak into california and the united states .,Democratic
the people at our ports and our borders are our first line of defense .,Democratic
that is why the intelligence reform bill included authorization for 10  000 new border guards  40  000 new detention beds to hold people awaiting deportation  and 4  000 new immigration inspectors .,Democratic
yet the president 's 2006 budget does not include funding for any of these new security improvements .,Democratic
if we are going to serious about border security  we need more resources and more people at the border .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to retain the real id provisions in the intelligence reform bill and reject this imposter .,Democratic
we already have the tools for securing driver 's licenses  and our borders that will truly make our country safer .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
i am deeply concerned about several aspects of this proposed legislation .,Democratic
this legislation  if passed  would be a terrible setback with regards to three critical areas : defending the people of the united states from terrorism  due process for immigrants  and environmental protection .,Democratic
the bill would undo security provisions that were passed just last year under the intelligence reform act .,Democratic
families of september 11th victims stated the impact of this legislation will not make us safer from terrorism .,Democratic
instead  it would prevent people from fleeing persecution  from obtaining relief  making our highways more dangerous and undermine our security .,Democratic
section 102 of this bill would eliminate homeland security and border patrol 's responsibility to inform and involve communities in proposed construction projects along the entire u.s. border and the requirement to consider less harmful alternatives to proposed actions .,Democratic
this would allow homeland security to operate in secrecy in critically important areas such as cabeza prieta and buenos aires national wildlife refuge and organ pipe national monument that are all in my district .,Democratic
many of our most precious wildlife depend upon protected public lands along u.s. borderlands for migration corridors between countries .,Democratic
in addition  this section would waive laws requiring consultations with native nations regarding activities on tribal lands  grave sites or archaeological and sacred sites .,Democratic
finally  in a rush to deport anyone  h.r.,Democratic
418 would deny due process for immigrants and asylum seekers .,Democratic
this is un-american .,Democratic
it is against what we stand for  and it is against what we are asking the world to replicate in democracy across this earth .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume  and thank the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today to oppose this rule and h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
the anti-immigrant provisions contained in this bill are unconscionable .,Democratic
we are a nation of immigrants  a nation that people  from time immemorial  have journeyed to for freedom .,Democratic
as ronald reagan said  `` america is a shining light on the hill.,Democratic
'' well  apparently  mr.,Democratic
speaker  today that light is red .,Democratic
we find ourselves in the second week of the second month of this legislative session  and we have yet to have a bill come to the floor with an open rule .,Democratic
and i remind the majority that that is shutting america out with reference to this debate .,Democratic
we are here today without a final rule because of a lack of agreement on which amendments to allow .,Democratic
well  i have a simple solution  one that should be obvious to all of us .,Democratic
i say  allow all amendments to be brought to the floor for a full and free debate by the house of representatives as envisioned by this nation 's founding fathers who were immigrants .,Democratic
let congress work its will on this legislation .,Democratic
to stifle debate on a bill as ill conceived as h.r.,Democratic
418 is undemocratic to the core .,Democratic
mr. speaker  there is no reason for hesitation .,Democratic
this is the only bill of substance on the house 's agenda this week .,Democratic
we have the opportunity to conduct an open debate on each radical section of this bill .,Democratic
as a country that prides itself on spreading democracy throughout the world  we must practice what we preach .,Democratic
allow the people to have their say by bringing h.r.,Democratic
418 to the floor with an open rule .,Democratic
do not shut america out .,Democratic
the changes to asylum law contained in h.r.,Democratic
418 will not improve our homeland security .,Democratic
terrorists do not have the right to seek asylum in our country and are already prohibited from doing so  but those who would legitimately seek refuge at our shores ought not to be turned away from our golden door through this bill 's misguided attempt at curbing immigration .,Democratic
nor will erosion of our personal privacy improve our security .,Democratic
the collection of unnecessary personal information by state agencies in an attempt to discern each and every person 's immigration standard goes against the very freedom this nation was founded on by immigrants and must be rejected .,Democratic
our nation 's security is of paramount importance ; but in an effort to achieve that goal  let us  a thriving nation of immigrants  not turn our backs on our history and our future .,Democratic
so before we replace the statue of liberty 's torch with a `` do not enter '' sign  let us reconsider in the most open of debates what that says about our great nation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am privileged to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
mcgovern ) xz4002630  my very good friend who serves on the committee on rules with me .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am privileged to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
harman ) xz4001660  my good friend  the ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from minnesota ( mr.,Democratic
oberstar ) xz4002990 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to my very good friend  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
gene green ) .,Democratic
mr. speaker  before yielding to my good friend from massachusetts  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i would say to my colleague from texas ( mr.,Democratic
gohmert ) xz4006510 i have not had an opportunity to talk to him  and i simply want to point out to him that all of us that have feelings regarding states ' rights line up in many respects alike .,Democratic
but the gentleman needs to know that the national governors association and the american association of motor vehicle administrators  the national conference of state legislators all oppose this legislation .,Democratic
and the primary reason that they do would be  had i known the gentleman 20 years ago  or 10 years ago  he would have been arguing that the federal government is sending unfunded mandates to the states .,Democratic
well  welcome to the federal government .,Democratic
this is an unfunded mandate .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am privileged to yield 4 minutes to my very good friend  the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
frank ) xz4001400 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i ask the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Democratic
gingrey ) whether he is on the committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
yes  sir .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the gentleman from georgia and i are on the committee on rules  and we know this measure did not come up until 2 hours just before we went in there .,Democratic
we also know there were no hearings .,Democratic
we also know that the 9/11 commission went much further than what the gentleman presented here today .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
berman ) xz4000250  a member of the committee on the judiciary  to give a more exemplary outline of what transpired .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume  and i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 for yielding me the customary time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  my colleagues on the other side  for the balance of these arguments today and during yesterday  said very frequently  and it was repeated again by the gentleman from texas  that the horrible people that were on the airplanes that did the dastardly deed here in america on september 11 had  collectively  63 driver 's licenses .,Democratic
that is  without any kind of misunderstanding between the two sides  they had these driver 's licenses  and there is no question about it .,Democratic
but one of the things that goes ignored is the fact that in the days before 9/11  including that day  airport review of driver 's licenses did not occur  and  therefore  it is a total irrelevancy .,Democratic
they were in this country  some on expired visas  some with visas that had been approved  and probably one or two with fraudulent visas .,Democratic
what in the world did driver 's licenses have to do with it ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today to oppose this rule and h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
and once again we see debate limited on this legislation for no reason .,Democratic
the bill is the only item on our legislative schedule today  yet debate on this bill has been limited to less than 2 hours .,Democratic
in fact  the number of proposed amendments has been sharply limited as well .,Democratic
only a fourth of the amendments submitted to the committee on rules will be allowed on the floor today  and what possible reason can the majority give for limiting debate in this matter ?,Democratic
surely  given the drastic nature of the changes to our asylum laws contained in h.r.,Democratic
418  it is in the best interests of the country to hold an open debate on this legislation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  last wednesday  the chairman of the committee on rules sent out an announcement notifying members  as is his responsibility  that all their proposed amendments to this bill were due in the committee on rules by noon on tuesday  february 8. all members who submitted their amendments  republicans and democrats  followed this rule ; all members  that is  except the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) .,Democratic
later tuesday afternoon  after the deadline had passed  the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) submitted an extensive 18-page amendment that made significant changes to the bill 's already controversial asylum sections .,Democratic
members had never seen this language before  and of course  no subcommittee or committee had a chance to review it or mark it up .,Democratic
in the short time we have had to review this new language  it appears to be more controversial than the bill 's original provisions .,Democratic
it appears to make it easier for an immigration judge to reject on asylum seeker based on subjective and cultural factors that are notoriously unreliable indicators of credibility .,Democratic
it also allows a person to be denied asylum based on any inconsistencies or falsehoods in their testimony  whether or not these inconsistencies are relevant to the person 's claim .,Democratic
i continue to harp on the fact that it does not protect children who are here and in need of asylum consideration .,Democratic
it does not protect women who are in forced slavery and prostitution and are raped .,Democratic
it does not protect them at all with reference to any asylum claims .,Democratic
and it places in the hands of one judge the judging of their credibility .,Democratic
the other thing ignored is the difficulty that the criteria set forth in h.r.,Democratic
418 present to asylum seekers  legitimate asylum seekers  to collect information regarding their birth records .,Democratic
in the district that i represent  more than a quarter of the work done in the district offices involves immigration  and one of the things that we find it difficult to accomplish is to have the people in a timely manner who are seeking status and naturalization in this country collect their birth records and records of a variety of things in their communities that simply are not there and are unavailable  and therefore their claims are delayed repeatedly .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this is a bad amendment  and members should have more time to study it .,Democratic
what is worse is that members today will not even have the opportunity to vote up or down on it .,Democratic
this rule makes it a part of h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
it is called `` self-executing.,Democratic
'' it sounds like a cute way of circumventing the democratic process to me .,Democratic
stifling free speech is downright un-american .,Democratic
one can not fail to see the irony here .,Democratic
right this minute our troops are in harm 's way to further democracy in a far-off country  while democracy here in the halls of congress is being shoved out the door .,Democratic
when the opportunity for a free debate is squelched  america loses  democracy loses .,Democratic
there is nothing to be gained by limiting ideas ; and that is what we have here today  the limiting of the ideas of the majority .,Democratic
they should not and it is wrong for them to shut the american people out .,Democratic
mr. speaker  h.r.,Democratic
418 also allows the secretary of homeland security to waive all laws necessary for the construction of the san diego border wall .,Democratic
none of us are of a mind to believe that the completion of the 3-mile gap in that wall should not be undertaken .,Democratic
but giving the secretary the power to override all federal laws that interfere with this project sets a horrible precedent .,Democratic
these laws exist for a reason  be it to ensure the safety of the environment or to safeguard important cultural artifacts .,Democratic
mr. speaker  how many more laws will we override in the name of homeland security ?,Democratic
none of us would argue that we should not do everything to protect the homeland  but rightly we should not argue to ignore the laws that also protect us in this homeland .,Democratic
the data collection envisioned by h.r.,Democratic
418 troubles me a lot .,Democratic
in this age of diminished personal privacy  this bill throws around terms such as `` mandatory facial image capture  '' and `` electronic storage of identity source documents  '' without fully explaining  and it is not explained ; and i ask anybody to explain it on the majority side  certainly for the american public  explaining fully how all this captured data will be used and by whom .,Democratic
i represent a district that  like america  is comprised of immigrants .,Democratic
many of the people of the 23rd congressional district of florida came to america as asylum seekers themselves .,Democratic
they came from places where notorious persecution and violation of human rights occurred  like haiti and cuba ; and they have worked hard  as many immigrants in this country who sought asylum  to create a new life for themselves and their families .,Democratic
whether they came 5 years ago or 50 years ago  they know others like them will continue to come to our shores fleeing persecution and desperation  seeking hope  protection and the promise of a better future .,Democratic
we have a moral responsibility to help them make it .,Democratic
it has not been lessened any more after 9/11 than it was before .,Democratic
the immigrants who founded this country had that moral responsibility  and throughout our history we have waxed and waned with reference to that moral responsibility .,Democratic
last night  i watched the so-called `` fair and balanced '' fox programming  and on that programming it happened that the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) was one of the guests .,Democratic
he made a sterling presentation .,Democratic
he did not falter in any of his principles with reference to this matter  and he went forward in a dignified manner to answer the questions asked .,Democratic
he did say  i believe  and he has not said that this measure is something that he does not think will help secure the homeland  as my colleague from texas has just said .,Democratic
but let me quote the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) from last night .,Democratic
he said  `` the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws.,Democratic
'' let me repeat the quote : `` the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws.,Democratic
'' now  the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) knows that president bush has proposed a budget that  rather than fulfilling what we said would protect our homeland by having 2  000 border patrol persons and an added number  800  ins  or bice  their new name  to their rolls so that we could enforce the immigration laws  what do we get in the proposed budget ?,Democratic
two hundred border patrol guards and 143 personnel for the immigration and naturalization service .,Democratic
what i am saying is let us put our emphasis where it ought to be  and let us not divert ourselves in this manner  and certainly let us not continue to shut all of those organizations  from the governors association all the way back across the board that are opposed to this law  let us not shut them out from having an opportunity to present themselves at a hearing .,Democratic
let us not shut out the people here in the house of representatives  some 41 who are newly here who have no idea what we did with reference to this matter last year and have not had time in order to be able to review it  sufficient to be able to make arguments on behalf of their constituencies in a satisfactory manner .,Democratic
let us not shut out the american public by continuing to not allow for open debate .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i oppose this rule and h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the rule and this ill-conceived legislation .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  many on this side of the aisle also support strong border protection .,Democratic
i certainly do  and i support the fence .,Democratic
this is not an argument  however  about whether to build a fence .,Democratic
it is about what process should be used  and this process is dead wrong .,Democratic
rather than reaching out to the governor of california  a leader in the party on the other side of the aisle  to reach compromise on this issue  the author of this bill has crafted language that will usurp all of governor schwarzenneger 's power regarding the border fence .,Democratic
to take the radical steps of eliminating all state and local powers  let alone federal  and rolling back all judicial review is the height of irresponsible legislating .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this bill sets the dangerous precedent of policing a single federal official  elected by no one  above all laws  and shields him from accountability  and the reach is beyond the san diego border .,Democratic
according to the language in this legislation  it is all areas along and in the vicinity of our international borders with both mexico and canada .,Democratic
this is the wrong way to do it .,Democratic
we need to do the right thing .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i support this amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to my good friend  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
doggett ) xz4001110 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume before i yield to the gentleman from massachusetts  which i will do gladly .,Democratic
i would say to the chairman that i respect very much  and i am speaking to the gentleman from california ( chairman dreier )  i respect very much what my good friend from california has said with reference to the rule  the amendments that are allowed .,Democratic
but i was in that same process as the chairman was in the committee on rules .,Democratic
three-quarters of the amendments that were submitted on time pursuant to the chairman 's correct direction to the body are not a part of the debate here .,Democratic
the sensenbrenner amendment  which is rather lengthy  came late to the committee .,Democratic
it is not being voted on up or down for the reason that it was made a self-executing part of the rule .,Democratic
now  the gentleman can call that fair and balanced  but let me just say to the chairman that there is a new section 105  and many of the members are hearing this for the first time .,Democratic
it eliminates federal court review in many conventions against torture cases  and it eliminates the power of the federal appeals court judges to stay the removal of asylum seekers .,Democratic
i do not think any irony is lost on the chairman about the ninth circuit 's ruling .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i gather those unfriendly nations were like saudi arabia where 15 of the 19 hijackers came from .,Democratic
yes  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
dreier ) xz4001150 said that a lot .,Democratic
he said that a lot .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am privileged to yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
frank ) xz4001400  my good friend .,Democratic
mr. speaker  how much time remains ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time  before the chairman leaves  just one further word in that regard .,Democratic
i take  from the many times when the chairman was in the minority  his statement to heart ; and that is that if a rule is not open  it is closed .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i remind my colleagues that there was no hearing with reference to this matter .,Democratic
there are 43 new members in the house of representatives who have absolutely no opportunity to have voiced themselves regarding this matter .,Democratic
there is a new committee on homeland security that is now permanent  rightly so .,Democratic
there was no hearing there .,Democratic
the gentleman from wisconsin 's ( mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 manager 's amendment came to the committee on rules 2 hours before we had an opportunity to see it  and i would urge in the house how many have read it even at this point .,Democratic
more importantly  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the immigration and naturalization service  bice  in the authorized budget that we presented to the president  it required 800 new officials for that agency .,Democratic
only 143 are in the president 's budget .,Democratic
i also include for the record the national conference of state legislatures ' letter in opposition and the national governors association and american association of motor vehicle administrators ' opposition to this measure .,Democratic
additionally  there are others who are too numerous to mention without great prolixity  but i will cite in the record some of the organizations that oppose this measure : the afl-cio ; the american jewish committee ; the anti-defamation league ; the asian american legal defense and education fund ; catholic charities usa and catholic bishops ; hebrew immigrant aid society ; the irish american unity conference ; the korean american coalition ; the mexican american legal defense and educational fund  and a footnote  all of the colleagues in the house that are latino and african american have signed on to a letter opposing this measure ; the national conference of state legislatures that i just mentioned ; the national council of la raza ; the service employees international union ; the arab-american anti-discrimination committee .,Democratic
and  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the republican liberty caucus opposes this measure .,Democratic
and in addition  thereto  in case someone thinks that there are a whole bunch of left wing crazies that are out here trying to protect the personal rights of individuals  the gunowners of america association opposes this measure and the american conservative union .,Democratic
i would think  then  that those 100-plus organizations should give us a lot of food for thought before we proceed .,Democratic
identity security  driver 's licenses and state identification cards states traditionally have maintained authority over the issuance of driver 's licenses and state identification cards .,Democratic
the principal purpose of the driver 's license is to certify individuals to operate a motorized vehicle and to secure automobile insurance .,Democratic
driver 's licenses also are used for numerous other purposes  including proof and verification of identity and as documents to qualify for a variety of commercial  financial  educational  governmental and other services .,Democratic
the driver 's licensing process and related regulatory activities are crucial for maintaining public safety  bolstering security  and reducing fraud and counterfeiting .,Democratic
states have renewed their scrutiny of driver 's licenses and have enacted and considered legislation to strengthen application processes  require expanded proof of identity  modify qualifications for license and identification card approval  deter fraudulent activity  and bolster privacy protections .,Democratic
although states retain authority over the driver 's license application and issuance processes  congress recently passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 to overhaul the nation 's intelligence systems .,Democratic
this legislation included federal standards for state issued driver 's licenses and personal identification cards that the states must enact or face the refusal of federal agencies to accept these documents for any official purpose .,Democratic
although ncsl opposed this federal mandate  ncsl worked with congress to ensure that state elected officials are included on a negotiated rulemaking committee  which will devise the federal standards  to apply the standards only to newly issued documents  and to require the secretary of the department of transportation to identify the cost of the federal standards on states prior to their implementation .,Democratic
ncsl is committed to preserving the congressional intent of the act by ensuring that state legislatures are represented on the negotiated rulemaking committee .,Democratic
ncsl strongly believes that the negotiated standards should provide states with maximum flexibility within the framework of the federal act to implement the standards .,Democratic
ncsl encourages the secretary of transportation to exercise his authority under the act to grant states extensions of the effective date if they make reasonable efforts to comply  and ncsl is committed to working with congress and the secretary to delay the implementation of the act if congress fails to appropriate funds to implement the standards .,Democratic
ncsl further encourages the secretary to exercise his authority under the act to include individuals from organizations that represent civil liberties and privacy interests on the negotiated rulemaking committee .,Democratic
although there is a need to strengthen the driver 's license application process and to address inadequacies  states remain best positioned to accomplish these goals .,Democratic
states have direct experience with driver 's license formatting  identity verification procedures and systems  customer service  qualifying and insuring drivers  testing potential and licensed drivers  and driver training .,Democratic
state laws and regulations guide these activities .,Democratic
states also are mindful of needs to protect consumers  taxpayers  business concerns and privacy  all of which must be taken into account while enhancing security and public safety .,Democratic
any federal standards should be narrowly limited to those areas enumerated in the federal act and should in no way limit the ability of states to innovate to strengthen the integrity of document verification and issuance .,Democratic
ncsl supports the innovative efforts at the state level to address security concerns with driver 's license issuance .,Democratic
currently  individual states are considering legislative and regulatory actions  interstate compacts  model legislation  intergovernmental agreements  data sharing  standards development through recognized standards-developing entities  and enhanced legislative and executive branch coordination .,Democratic
ncsl will provide organizational support to states as they opt to pursue any or all of these or other avenues to reform .,Democratic
ncsl will oppose any federal legislative or regulatory effort to require states to adopt specific model legislation or participate in an interstate compact .,Democratic
ncsl believes that the federal government does have a significant role in assisting states with matters regarding non-citizens and their qualification for and use of state-issued driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
states need direct links to verifiable  timely and accurate date regarding status  duration of stay  application for change in status and related information .,Democratic
the expanding number of visas  backlogs on applications for status changes and inability to either access or navigate department of homeland security data systems are among the problems requiring resolution so that states can administer non-citizen applications for driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
without these changes  states can not be expected to  nor be held accountable for  providing enhanced security in their driver 's license application and issuance processes.* this discussion has rekindled debate and concern about the development of a national identification card or national driver 's license .,Democratic
ncsl continues to believe that there is no compelling reason to establish such national cards or licenses and will work with congress and federal officials to ensure that such an establishment is not achieved -- either intentionally or unintentionally -- through legislation  regulation or rulemaking process .,Democratic
ncsl believes that states must establish am ore cooperative working relationship on this issue with the federal government .,Democratic
therefore  ncsl supports a federal role in providing technical support  highlighting successful models  facilitating discussion and providing necessary funding for changes made at the discretion of the states .,Democratic
ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coercion or direct preemption  to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level .,Democratic
ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 .,Democratic
motor vehicle administrators  february 8  2005 .,Democratic
dear mr .,Democratic
speaker  representative delay and representative pelosi : we write to express our opposition to title ii of h.r.,Democratic
418  the `` improved security for driver 's licenses and personal identification cards '' provision  and h.r.,Democratic
368  the `` driver 's license security and modernization act '' .,Democratic
while governors and motor vehicle administrators share your concern for increasing the security and integrity of the driver 's license and state identification processes  we firmly believe that the driver 's license and id card provisions of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 offer the best course for meeting those goals .,Democratic
the `` driver 's licenses and personal identification cards '' provision in the intelligence reform act of 2004 provides a workable framework for developing meaningful standards to increase reliability and security of driver 's licenses and id cards .,Democratic
this framework calls for input from state elected officials and motor vehicle administrators in the regulatory process  protects state eligibility criteria  and retains the flexibility necessary to incorporate best practices from around the states .,Democratic
we have begun to work with the u.s. department of transportation to develop the minimum standards  which must be completed in 18 months pursuant to the intelligence reform act .,Democratic
we commend chairman sensenbrenner and chairman davis for their commitment to driver 's license integrity ; however  both h.r.,Democratic
418 and h.r.,Democratic
368 would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states  many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government .,Democratic
moreover  the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses issued by states represents a massive unfunded federal mandate .,Democratic
our states have made great strides since the september 11  2001 terrorists attacks to enhance the security processes and requirements for receiving a valid driver 's and id card .,Democratic
the framework in the intelligence reform act of 2004 will allow us to work cooperatively with the federal government to develop and implement achievable standards to prevent document fraud and other illegal activity related to the issuance of driver 's licenses and id cards .,Democratic
we urge you to allow the provisions in the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work .,Democratic
governors and motor vehicle administrators are committed to this process because it will allow us to develop mutually agreed-upon standards that can truly help create a more secure america .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) has cited the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
after 9/11  shortly thereafter  i wrote to president bush and introduced legislation that would set the precursor to what ultimately became the department of homeland security of this house of representatives .,Democratic
during that period of time  i did not have the courtesy of a response from the white house  and the white house opposed setting up inside the administration a cabinet-level homeland security official .,Democratic
ultimately  they came around .,Democratic
tim roemer  a former colleague of ours who did serve on the 9/11 commission  and myself and others filed the original legislation leading to the development of the 9/11 independent commission .,Democratic
and my colleague has cited that commission frequently  but i defy him on the subject of border security  page 186  to tell me anywhere where it says anything about driver 's licenses .,Democratic
they talk about creating an interagency center to target illegal entry and human traffickers ; imposing tighter controls on student visas ; taking legal action to prevent terrorists from coming into the united states and to remove those already here ; further increasing the number of immigration agents to fbi joint terrorism task forces ; activating a special court to enable the use of classified evidence .,Democratic
and i could go on and on and on in the clark working group and the 9/11 report  and not one word  not one word regarding any driver 's licenses .,Democratic
people that are going to do harm in this nation are not going to do anything other than everything that is fraudulent .,Democratic
but what we need to know is that there are a variety of people who are significantly opposed to this legislation .,Democratic
the afl-cio  the american jewish committee  the asian american legal defense and education fund  catholic charities usa  the hebrew immigrant aid society  irish american unity conference  gun owners of america  the american conservative union  the republican liberty caucus  the national association of latino elected officials  the national conference of state legislatures  the council of la raza  the federation of filipino american association  the service employees union ; and there is a list that goes up to 121 organizations that have been shut out because there were no hearings and no opportunity for them to have been heard  other than through the limited debate .,Democratic
we should stop this business of closing our opportunities and open up the rules .,Democratic
i oppose this rule .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
berman ) xz4000250  my very good friend .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act .,Democratic
this legislation was crafted under the guise of protecting our borders and improving homeland security .,Democratic
however  it would make it more difficult for victims of persecution to obtain asylum impose expensive mandates on the states  and authorize the secretary of homeland security to waive any and all laws to construct barriers at our international borders -- none of which will make this country any safer from terrorists .,Democratic
this legislation would also effectively undo the important immigration and security reforms passed by the 108th congress  putting us at greater risk for future attacks .,Democratic
the 9/11 commission 's immigration-related recommendations focused on targeting terrorist travel through reliable identification systems and effective  integrated information sharing .,Democratic
instead  this legislation seeks to change immigration laws broadly and in ways unrelated to essential intelligence reform .,Democratic
this legislation would expand the authority for expedited alien removal without further hearing or review  impose stringent restrictions on asylum seekers hoping to be given an interview with an asylum officer  and require unreasonable standards of proof for aliens seeking asylum .,Democratic
none of the 9/11 hijackers sought or were granted asylum ; rather  they were granted legal visas to enter the united states using fraudulent documents overseas .,Democratic
furthermore  current law explicitly bars terrorists or members of terrorist organizations from gaining asylum  and asylum-seekers already undergo thorough background checks through the fbi  cia  department of homeland security  and department of state databases .,Democratic
the onerous restrictions offered by h.r.,Democratic
418 would keep highly-vulnerable victims of heinous crimes from escaping their persecutors  and they do not address the real vulnerabilities in our immigration system .,Democratic
a report released this week by the united states commission on international religious freedom underscores the dangerous impact these so-called reforms would have on our asylum process .,Democratic
according to the commission  the current expedited removal process in the u.s. places victims of persecution at great risk for further trauma  while the severity of conditions and deprivation imposed on asylum seekers was `` shocking.,Democratic
'' rather than address this serious situation in the ways recommended by the commission  today this congress would force even more innocent asylum seekers into expedited removal or send them back to their persecutors without an opportunity to appeal their case to an immigration judge .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 would also impose statutory requirements for state-issued driver 's licenses and repeal the important identification security measures enacted by the bipartisan intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act .,Democratic
rather than permit local  state  and federal officials to work together to create minimum security standards for driver 's licenses and identification cards as authorized by congress last year  h.r.,Democratic
418 would mandate statutory standards for states and require them to share personal information on all licensed drivers in a massive national database .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 would dismantle the carefully crafted immigration and security reforms enacted by congress last year in the intelligence reform bill .,Democratic
that law will toughen our border security by adding 10  000 new border patrol agents over the next 5 years  strengthening visa application requirements  and adding 4  000 new immigration and customs investigators .,Democratic
it fortifies identification security while allowing the state officials charged with making those changes to be a part of the process .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this law implemented key 9/11 commission recommendations without jeopardizing our legal immigration system or the ability of legitimate asylum seekers to escape persecution .,Democratic
our country was founded on the principle of immigration  and we must not close our doors to those who lawfully seek to share in the freedom and democracy that americans have always held dear .,Democratic
the congress must do everything in its power to protect our citizens and our borders .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418  however  does not achieve those important goals  and i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to oppose the iraqi supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 .,Democratic
to call this legislation a travesty is to put it nicely .,Democratic
it is nothing but $ 81 billion of chaos blanketed in lofty-sounding phrases like `` tsunami relief '' and `` supporting our troops.,Democratic
'' actually  this bill represents a mockery of the democratic process .,Democratic
calling this bill an `` emergency supplemental '' implies that the bush administration and congress were somehow not aware of these costs .,Democratic
that is ridiculous .,Democratic
the only unforeseen cost contained in this $ 81 billion dollar boondoggle is the $ 656 million for tsunami relief .,Democratic
both congress and the administration have known for months that $ 75 billion in the bill for the wars in iraq and afghanistan would be needed  but we did n't put it in the budget .,Democratic
the real story is that the bush administration is attempting to hide from the american people the real costs of a mismanaged war .,Democratic
the administration once claimed the war in iraq would cost $ 1.7 billion .,Democratic
this supplemental alone is almost 50 times that amount .,Democratic
is the administration out to lunch ?,Democratic
tomorrow  the house is going to consider a budget resolution that  like the previous year  fails to include adequate funding for the war in iraq .,Democratic
i 'm not a soothsayer  mr.,Democratic
speaker  but dare i warn  `` beware of the ides of march.,Democratic
'' if tomorrow 's republican budget is passed  we 're going to be here next march writing the bush administration another check to cover the costs of its campaign of nation building .,Democratic
the bush administration is hiding behind the rhetoric of supporting our troops to escape accountability for the war in iraq  and the american people should be outraged .,Democratic
we should be embarrassed that members in this body are so willing to write blank checks to a president who has yet to justify how the $ 175 billion in already appropriated money in iraq and afghanistan has been spent .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am even more appalled by the manner in which funding for clandestine operations is being carried out in this bill .,Democratic
this bill allocates a massive amount of money for covert operations  yet the department of defense did not see fit to go through either of the two house authorizing committees of jurisdiction .,Democratic
congress is creating a private bank account for secretary rumsfield without any oversight or permission from the united states congress .,Democratic
is this what the american people want -- government by fiat ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  our government has a process  and this process is vital to preserving the nature of our democracy .,Democratic
i should n't have to explain that .,Democratic
all of the bush administration 's rhetoric about global freedom apparently does not extend to the united states capitol building .,Democratic
what is more important for the bush administration is that they get their money at all and any costs .,Democratic
i guess that means they will sell this bill on the altruistic notions of patriotism and humanitarianism in a snide attempt to drum up support .,Democratic
why is this bill being dubbed a tsunami relief effort when the entire supplemental is over 120 times the amount allocated for the tsunami ?,Democratic
what about the six hundred million dollars to build the world 's biggest embassy in baghdad ?,Democratic
what are they building this thing out of -- pure lead ?,Democratic
that same amount of money could go towards vital security upgrades at other embassies and consulates around the world .,Democratic
why do n't we just make things easier on everyone by throwing this bill out the window and opening up everyone 's bank accounts to the united states executive branch ?,Democratic
now that 's privatization .,Democratic
this is n't a question of patriotism  nor is it a question of our commitment to helping tsunami victims recover .,Democratic
this is an issue with short and long-term constitutional and budgetary ramifications .,Democratic
i realize that the bush administration feels it would be easier to simply govern without any input or oversight  but the first three articles of the constitution suggest otherwise .,Democratic
i can not in good conscience support legislation that  for all we know  might pour billions in the pockets of halliburton while depriving our troops of necessary resources .,Democratic
and i ca n't imagine why the united states congress  led by the appropriations committee  is handing a leash to the white house and waiting to be taken out for a walk .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am outraged by this crass attempt to shirk congressional responsibility  and i urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation .,Democratic
i am  mr.,Democratic
speaker  in its present form .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from georgia .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i take this time for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come .,Democratic
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman for the schedule .,Democratic
with reference to the real id bill  mr.,Democratic
leader  can you tell us at this point in time the type of rule that that will be considered under ; and  in particular  what amendments  not necessarily specific amendments  but whether amendments will be allowed  motions to recommit  and items of that nature .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
so the gentleman is talking about merging it at some time in the future after passage ?,Democratic
mr. leader  with respect to the energy bill  it is my understanding that there is some discussion that the energy bill may proceed not next week but the week following .,Democratic
can you tell me whether that is a reasonable possibility  or probability ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today to offer a motion to recommit that would provide $ 100 million in health and $ 50 million in job training transitional assistance to help active duty forces make the transition to the veterans benefits system .,Democratic
the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
baird ) xz4000110 and i have been working on this issue together and trying to add $ 1.3 billion for va health care and reintegration services .,Democratic
while our amendment was ruled not in order  we now have a chance to ensure that this supplemental includes at least some funding for vital health and employment services .,Democratic
america is currently asking more of its all-volunteer military force than it ever has before .,Democratic
yet even as america prepares to continue its large and prolonged military campaign in iraq  it has done very little to provide for the veterans of this war .,Democratic
our obligation to support our troops does not end when they leave iraq .,Democratic
but how are we supposed to provide adequate health care to these new veterans when we did not even meet the needs of our current veterans ?,Democratic
the fiscal year 2005 omnibus was $ 1.3 billion short in the amount that then secretary principi  as well as the house committee on veterans ' affairs  stated was needed to just maintain the current level of veterans health care .,Democratic
we also need to make sure that our returning soldiers have the readjustment assistance they need  particularly for members of the guard and reserve .,Democratic
you have to understand  these members do not go back to a base  they go back to their home state and then are scattered throughout that state .,Democratic
members of the national guard returning home face immense challenges in transitioning out of active duty deployment and back to civilian life .,Democratic
while the state guard offices are working to provide these returning soldiers with important information regarding their health care  employment assistance and other transitional services  they simply do not have the money they need to complete the education and counseling necessary for a smooth transition back to civilian life .,Democratic
i think our returning soldiers deserve better .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and keep our promise to our nation 's veterans .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee on ways and means  but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
thomas ) and the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
rangel ) work closely together  and perhaps their respective chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together  would be very  very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the congress and never gets to the president .,Democratic
if  in fact  we consider that  and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be on the floor  but if and when it comes to the floor  mr.,Democratic
leader  would you contemplate the possibility of having an open rule on that piece of legislation  given its importance and scope ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i would hope on that bill  because of its great importance to the security of the nation and to all of our consumers of energy  which is to say all of us  that we would have as broad a consideration of it as possible so that we could get everybody 's ideas put on the floor  voted up or down  and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the majority leader .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am of course going to vote for this emergency supplemental appropriation because i believe it is absolutely imperative to support our brave men and women in harm 's way in afghanistan and iraq .,Democratic
i know that even today  2 years after the onset of operation iraqi freedom  there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation on the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prosecution of our military effort in iraq .,Democratic
however  on this point  i believe there is unanimity .,Democratic
we  the elected representatives of the american people  have a legislative duty as well as a moral responsibility  to do everything in our power to ensure that our troops have everything they need to defeat the vicious insurgency in iraq  to assist the iraqi people in establishing democracy  and continuing our efforts in afghanistan .,Democratic
in my view  however  we are not doing enough .,Democratic
just last week  the new york times reported the experience of marine company e  an experience that  `` was punctuated not only by a lack of armor  but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in the battle.,Democratic
'' i am pleased  mr.,Democratic
speaker  that this bill includes $ 1.4 billion more than the administration requested for bolstering force protection needs such as add-on armor and night vision goggles  and  in addition  for outfitting troops rotating into iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
over the last 4 years  this administration  however  has refused to ask the american people  particularly the wealthiest american people  to make even minimal sacrifices  while we ask our men and women in afghanistan and iraq for some to make the ultimate sacrifice .,Democratic
the very least  in my opinion  that we can do is give them the resources they need to achieve victory and to return home safely .,Democratic
i also support  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the important funding in this bill for tsunami relief  foreign assistance  and domestic homeland security as well as the $ 200 million in assistance for the palestinian authority for infrastructure and economic development projects .,Democratic
those are all worthwhile  necessary  and important projects .,Democratic
the political reforms taking place in the territories must be accompanied by an end to the poverty and lack of opportunity facing the palestinian people .,Democratic
that is ultimately how we will defeat terrorism .,Democratic
finally  however  let me raise  mr.,Democratic
speaker  one objection  among others  to the funding bill : the $ 592 million for a new embassy compound in baghdad .,Democratic
that is not an emergency .,Democratic
this funding  mr.,Democratic
speaker  is not only inappropriate in this emergency supplemental appropriation  but it also  in my opinion  is substantially excessive in its expenditures ; not to keep the people safe  we can do that  but to create an embassy in a relatively small country that  hopefully  in the years ahead  will be more peaceful than we have found it .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i believe that we are at a critical juncture in iraq .,Democratic
victory is imperative  although it is not certain .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to support this conference report .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin  and i thank our new chairman and congratulate him on his new position .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i intend to vote for this supplemental appropriations bill  because i believe it is imperative to support our men and women in harm 's way in iraq and afghanistan and to continue our nation 's important work there .,Democratic
our nation must finish what it has begun .,Democratic
we can not disregard the bravery of millions of iraqi citizens who turned out to vote in january .,Democratic
failure there  in my opinion  is not and should not be an option .,Democratic
this legislation also is a recognition of the bravery and courage of our service men and women  more than 1  500 of whom have given the ultimate measure of sacrifice for freedom .,Democratic
as tom friedman pointed out in the new york times in february : `` there is no single action we could undertake anywhere in the world to reduce the threat of terrorism that would have a bigger impact today than a decent outcome in iraq.,Democratic
'' i share that view .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i believe it is more than mere coincidence that over the last several months the winds of democratic reform have begun to blow  not only in iraq and afghanistan but also in lebanon  egypt  saudi arabia  and the palestinian authority .,Democratic
but we must harbor no illusions about the prospects for democratic reform in lands that have never known it .,Democratic
however  i believe that it is in our nation 's interests to encourage and promote it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i also want to note that this legislation includes funding for food and humanitarian assistance in sudan  as well as tsunami relief .,Democratic
however  despite these important funding requests  i would be remiss if i did not point out that this bill is far from perfect .,Democratic
in many respects it is troubling .,Democratic
this congress has a constitutional obligation  a duty  on behalf of the voters who elected us to serve here to hold the administration accountable for such expenditures .,Democratic
we have asked for a report .,Democratic
we have not gotten that report yet .,Democratic
the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860 mentioned that in our markup .,Democratic
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391 mentioned that in our markup .,Democratic
the american public wants to support this effort but wants to do so in an effective  honest and efficient manner .,Democratic
it is our responsibility to ensure that .,Democratic
it is clear that the administration has included many measures in addition that are not emergencies .,Democratic
we understand that practice .,Democratic
it has happened before .,Democratic
but i believe with all due respect that we have not met our oversight requirements .,Democratic
this bill is approximately $ 82 billion .,Democratic
in talking to staff  and maybe i stand to be corrected  but i believe that there are only two appropriations bills  defense and labor and health that are larger than this $ 82 billion bill .,Democratic
now there may be another one .,Democratic
i think va-hud used to be but we do not have va-hud .,Democratic
what does that mean ?,Democratic
that means we are passing the third largest appropriations bill that we will pass in the congress .,Democratic
what does that mean ?,Democratic
we are passing the third largest appropriations bill through this house without a single hearing  not one .,Democratic
there was no hearing in subcommittee  any of the subcommittees .,Democratic
there was no hearing in the full committee .,Democratic
we had 2 1/2 hours of consideration in the full committee .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as you know  we literally hold hundreds  perhaps thousands of hours of hearings on the individual bills .,Democratic
as a result  individual members have the opportunity to ask questions  to make sure themselves that the money that is asked for is being spent appropriately .,Democratic
as i said  i will support this bill .,Democratic
i do not hold our new chairman responsible for this .,Democratic
this is a supplemental .,Democratic
it came down relatively late .,Democratic
our men and women are at risk .,Democratic
we need to get this money moving .,Democratic
i understand that .,Democratic
but i suggest to my colleagues that oversight is critical  and i would urge the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391 and the ranking member  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000  that as we proceed with further consideration of these items that we exercise oversight carefully in the coming months to assure ourselves that this money is being spent as we intend it to be .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong support of this amendment that aims to commit $ 3 million to the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) .,Democratic
the unfpa has asked its donor countries for about $ 28 million for women who were victims of the tsunami .,Democratic
the money in this amendment is about 11 percent of what they are asking for .,Democratic
in january  i visited areas devastated by the tsunami .,Democratic
i visited what was left of a three-story maternity hospital .,Democratic
three hundred women and infants were located here when the first wave hit .,Democratic
the rush of water toppled a high cement fence  knocked down utility polls like toothpicks  and shattered all of the glass windows in the front facade .,Democratic
of the 300 women and their babies  all but one -- a newborn -- was saved from the crashing waves .,Democratic
we met with one doctor who finished a c-section -- in absolute darkness  after the generators were underwater  as the rest of the building was evacuated .,Democratic
the hospital was practically destroyed .,Democratic
the beds were pushed and piled against each other by the flooding  and shards of glass crunched under our feet .,Democratic
the sheets were strewn about like wet rags  and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles .,Democratic
natural disasters are particularly harsh on pregnant women .,Democratic
the loss of medical care and its infrastructure is compounded by malnutrition  disease and the trauma of the disaster .,Democratic
these issues can cause miscarriage or early labor  which both require medical care that is unavailable .,Democratic
the result can be maternal death .,Democratic
the situation that women face in the areas is dire .,Democratic
the indonesian midwife association has also reported that 1  650 of their 5  500 members  that is about 30 percent of their members  died in the tsunami .,Democratic
many of the surviving midwives are picking up the pieces of their own lives and dealing with their personal loss .,Democratic
reestablishing maternal health services will be a main use of this money  which is of great concern to the region .,Democratic
there are 150  000 pregnant women in the tsunami-affected areas -- 50  000 are scheduled to give birth in the next three months .,Democratic
they need personal hygiene kits in refugee camps ; and safe-birthing kits in hospitals  clinics and health centers .,Democratic
they need soap and sterile cotton cloth  antibiotics  emergency obstetric equipment  and drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections .,Democratic
relief efforts often overlook these supplies  and the unfpa is uniquely prepared to provide them .,Democratic
the unfpa has experience working with women in disaster areas : they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories .,Democratic
they already have offices in tsunami-affected countries  and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children .,Democratic
women are more vulnerable to sexual assaults during times of disaster .,Democratic
women who are pregnant  nursing  or caring for small children do not have the capacity to stand in line for long periods of time for supplies .,Democratic
the funds in this amendment are intended to be used by the unfpa to help women in these circumstances by : providing tools and medicines needed for safe childbirth ; preventing and treating sexual assault ; promoting access to clean water  food and healthcare ; providing sanitary supplies ; and providing psycho-social counseling .,Democratic
the tsunami devastated an entire region  and i am glad that this congress is appropriating funds to help address the many issues that the people in region now face .,Democratic
it is my hope that my colleagues will vote for this amendment  which will help some of the most vulnerable of the region .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise to question the omission of an amendment sponsored by mrs.,Democratic
maloney  ms.,Democratic
sanchez  mr.,Democratic
crowley and myself  which was agreed to by the chairman of appropriations .,Democratic
the amendment took $ 3 million from the `` economic support fund '' and put it toward the `` tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund  '' for the express purpose of the providing the united nations population fund  unfpa with these funds .,Democratic
this past january  i toured the region that was overwhelmed by the tsunami .,Democratic
the extent of the destruction was massive  and i was glad to see the world contributing to relief efforts .,Democratic
however  i was concerned that the special needs of women were not being adequately addressed .,Democratic
i visited the remains of a three-story maternity hospital .,Democratic
there were 300 women and infants in that hospital when the first wave hit .,Democratic
the tsunami toppled a cement wall  flattened utility polls  and shattered all of the glass windows in the front of the building .,Democratic
of the 300 women and their babies  all but one  a newborn  were saved from the crashing waves .,Democratic
i met a doctor who finished a c-section in absolute darkness  after the generators were underwater  as the rest of the building was evacuated .,Democratic
the hospital was practically destroyed .,Democratic
the beds were pushed and piled against each other by the flooding  and shards of glass crunched under our feet .,Democratic
the sheets were strewn about like wet rags  and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles .,Democratic
it is conditions like these that the unfpa addresses .,Democratic
the organization has experience working with women in disaster areas ; they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories .,Democratic
they already have offices in tsunami-affected countries  and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children .,Democratic
when i visited in january  there were an estimated 150  000 pregnant women in the tsunami-affected areas .,Democratic
the unfpa has worked to supply safe-birthing kits and emergency obstetric equipment .,Democratic
women who are in refugee camps need personal hygiene kits  soap  sterile cotton cloth  antibiotics  and drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections .,Democratic
although relief efforts often overlook these supplies  and the unfpa has done its best to fulfill these needs .,Democratic
unfpa 's priorities are reproductive health  including safe childbirth  prevention of violence against women and girls  and counseling for those affected by the 26 december tsunami .,Democratic
for many of these women  they must now become the head of the household .,Democratic
they have become widows overnight  and must deal with the emotional and economic issues involved with being the sole breadwinner in an area with no jobs .,Democratic
in early january  unfpa asked for $ 28 million to support its tsunami-related work .,Democratic
our amendment would have given them $ 3 million  which is about 11 percent of what they requested .,Democratic
by late february  over 70 percent of the requested funding had been received or pledged .,Democratic
germany gave $ 8 million .,Democratic
japan gave $ 5.5 million .,Democratic
the netherlands gave $ 1.5 million .,Democratic
norway gave $ 1 million .,Democratic
new zealand gave $ 700  000 .,Democratic
the united states has not given anything to this organization that is the most experienced and successful in addressing the distinctive needs of women during times of natural disaster .,Democratic
but this is not unusual .,Democratic
we have not given the unfpa the money they need for some time .,Democratic
the omnibus for 2005 earmarked $ 34 million for unfpa  however  the unfpa has not and will not receive it .,Democratic
the unfpa also received no funds from the united states in 2002  2003  and 2004 .,Democratic
unfortunately  the president will not release these funds to this organization  because of issues related to abortion .,Democratic
the money would not have been used for abortion .,Democratic
the money would have helped women deliver their babies .,Democratic
it would have helped women who have been sexually assaulted .,Democratic
it would have given women some of the tools they need to take care of themselves and their children .,Democratic
it is unconscionable that this congress would not allocate this $ 3 million to unfpa .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer two amendments and ask unanimous consent they be considered en bloc .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i would be pleased to yield to my friend  the gentleman from texas  the majority leader  for the purposes of informing us of the schedule .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my amendment is very simple .,Democratic
it adds $ 50 million for disaster assistance and $ 50 million for refugee assistance in sudan and other african countries .,Democratic
if this amendment passes  the house product would still be $ 550 million below the president 's request .,Democratic
so for colleagues that argue we are spending too much money  this amendment is fiscally prudent .,Democratic
but more importantly  adopting this amendment is quite frankly the right thing to do .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my amendment could be the most decent  moral and effective $ 100 million spent in this bill .,Democratic
this $ 100 million in disaster relief and refugee assistance would go very far in alleviating the multiple disasters and refugee crisis in africa .,Democratic
most of africa 's urgent humanitarian needs are shockingly affordable .,Democratic
sadly  what we have been missing is the political will to stand up and do something .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the president speaks often about ending evil  about reaching into your heart and doing the right thing .,Democratic
the number of deaths  over 1  300 a day in sudan and the democratic republic of the congo  that could be prevented would truly be ending evil and we know this is the right thing to do .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the only way for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing .,Democratic
i urge a `` yea '' vote on the jackson amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
section 425 of the budget act states that a point of order lies against legislation which imposes an underfunded mandate against state or local governments more than 62 million per year over 5 years .,Democratic
at the very least  mr.,Democratic
speaker  we have before us today an unfunded mandate that will cost state governments between $ 660 million and $ 780 million over the next 5 years alone .,Democratic
it has come to my attention that the national governors association is opposed to this legislation for that very fact .,Democratic
specifically  subparagraphs b  c  d  and e of section 202 of h.r.,Democratic
418 requires state governments to comply with new federal driver 's license requirements and to verify and store additional personal identification records  which the congressional budget office  cbo  in its latest estimate projects to cost $ 120 million over the next 5 years  but last estimated costs states $ 240 million over 5 years .,Democratic
there have been no substantive changes since last year 's to imply that this bill would not cost the states at least $ 240 million as estimated by the last congress .,Democratic
the above sections also require states to participate in an interstate database to share driver information  which cbo estimates will cost an additional $ 80 million over 3 years .,Democratic
in addition  by necessary implication  the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates which cbo has estimated would cost states $ 460 million over the next 5 years .,Democratic
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill  which has bypassed the committee process  denies members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes or to determine alternatives to ensure that all of us are on the same page in the war against terrorism .,Democratic
the opportunity to determine changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation was not given to us  and it will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local law enforcement 's role in securing the homeland .,Democratic
even further  this bill was drafted without any input from the governors and state legislatures and even excludes the states from the standard-setting process despite states ' historic roles as the issuers of driver 's licenses and other identification data .,Democratic
we must be in partnership with our states if we are going to have a real war against terror in the united states .,Democratic
for these reasons  the nationals governors association  as i indicated ; the american association of motor vehicle administrators ; and the national conference of state legislatures all strongly oppose this legislation in its present form .,Democratic
in a letter issued yesterday  the national governors association  american association of motor vehicle administrators say that they are in opposition to the driver 's license provision in both h.r.,Democratic
418 and h.r.,Democratic
368  stating the costs of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses by states represents a massive unfunded mandate .,Democratic
this does not say that in a bipartisan manner reasoned out through committee process done very quickly that some addressing of this question can not be properly answered .,Democratic
the national conference of state legislatures also has voiced strong opposition  stating that ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coercion or direct preemption to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level .,Democratic
ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 .,Democratic
what we have here today is an assault on federalism in the legislative process .,Democratic
the point of order is not about whether one agrees or disagree with the sweeping policy changes of the real id act .,Democratic
this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states ' rights and inflated the burden on our local governments without their input .,Democratic
i urge members to vote `` no '' on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of their home states ' legislature  governor  and local governments  along with the people of the united states .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i raise a point of order .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
conyers ) xz4000800  distinguished ranking member of the full house committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
mr. speaker  pursuant to section 426 of the congressional budget act of 1974  i make a point of order against consideration of the rule  h. res.,Democratic
71 .,Democratic
line 10 on page 2 of h. res.,Democratic
71 states  `` all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.,Democratic
'' the rule makes in order h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act of 2005  which contains a large unfunded mandate on state governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act .,Democratic
section 426 of the budget act specifically states that the rules committee may not waive section 425  and therefore this rule violates section 426 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i thank my colleague from texas for his comments .,Democratic
i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it .,Democratic
let me just say to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670  because i know his commitment to fiscal responsibility  let me refer him back to the cbo report of 2004 .,Democratic
we appreciate the cbo  but we know what happened ; and i think it is more important to know what the impact will be on the states on the basis of the national governors association and state legislatures .,Democratic
in 2004  on this very same bill  the cbo told what the numbers would be .,Democratic
it was not under $ 62 million .,Democratic
in fact  it was mr.,Democratic
speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. leader  i might say that i think all of us understand the importance of energy legislation .,Democratic
all of us understand the necessity to become energy independent .,Democratic
i would suggest  in that framework  that i think personally that we can pass an energy bill .,Democratic
obviously  there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other .,Democratic
i would hope  mr.,Democratic
leader  if we could  in working with the various committee chairs  and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
barton ) xz4000180 and the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
dingell ) xz4001100 in this respect  to come to as bipartisan an agreement on the substance of that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house of representatives  which may be interesting in terms of the political claim that we passed it  but which does nothing for our energy independence  which is  i think  our objective .,Democratic
so i would hope that we could deal with this in as bipartisan a fashion as possible so that when we send it to the other body that we may have more success there  more success out of conference  and send a bill to the president that will facilitate both energy independence and the effective and efficient discovery  development  and delivery at retail to the consumer of energy options .,Democratic
i do not know whether you want to say anything .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  my good friend knows we all have the greatest respect for the cbo  but the cbo analyzes what they are given .,Democratic
i might invite my colleague to read the cbo estimate  which clearly states that this is going to cost more than is indicated by this rule and by the legislation .,Democratic
in fact  it is clear that in addition  by necessary implication  the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates  which cbo has estimated would cost states $ 460 billion over the next 5 years .,Democratic
i would venture to say the competents of the cbo could be put on the witness stand  and they would attest to the fact that this is what it was going to cost .,Democratic
so this is not in any way casting aspersions on their good work .,Democratic
it is what has been presented to them  and they have analyzed it .,Democratic
it is not an accurate picture  what has been presented to them this year  because they documented that this is a more than $ 450 million program .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this violates the rule  and it violates the waiver where  in essence  the republicans indicated in their early beginnings in the majority that they would not allow unfunded mandates to go forward on this floor .,Democratic
i joined them in that .,Democratic
i ask my colleagues to support this point of order  so we stand here united in a bipartisan way not to support an unfunded mandate .,Democratic
the actual merits of the bill  mr.,Democratic
speaker  can be discussed  as my colleague has said  later on during the day .,Democratic
we are discussing at this moment the value of this bill .,Democratic
it is excessive .,Democratic
it is burdensome .,Democratic
it is an unfunded mandate  and it might hamper our war against terrorism and the protection of our homeland .,Democratic
let us try to do this in a more effective way .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i raise my point of order  and ask my colleagues to support it .,Democratic
section 425 of the budget act states that a point of order lies against legislation which imposes an unfunded mandate against state or local governments more than $ 62 million per year over 5 years .,Democratic
at the very least we have before us today an unfunded mandate that will cost state governments between $ 660 million and $ 780 million over the next 5 years alone .,Democratic

even further  this bill was drafted without any input from governors and state legislatures and even excludes the states from the standard-setting process despite states ' historic roles as issuers of driver 's licenses and other identification data .,Democratic
for these reasons the national governors association  american association of motor vehicle administrators  and the national conferences of state legislatures all strongly oppose this legislation .,Democratic
in a letter issued yesterday the national governors association and the american association of motor vehicle administrators stated their opposition to the drivers license provisions in both h.r.,Democratic
418 and h.r.,Democratic
368  stating : the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses by states represent a massive unfunded mandate the national conference of state legislatures also has voiced its strong opposition  stating that : ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coersion or direct preemption  to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level .,Democratic
ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 .,Democratic
what we have before us today is an assault on federalism and the legislative process .,Democratic
this point of order is not about whether you agree or disagree with the sweeping policy changes of the real id act .,Democratic
this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states ' rights and inflated the burden on our local governments .,Democratic
i urge members to vote `` no '' on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of your home states ' legislatures  governors and local governments .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
linda t. snchez )  a distinguished member of the house committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
mr. chairman  it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890  a strong advocate for preserving the constitution .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am delighted that the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 has indicated that the amendment has been made in order  and i do want to acknowledge that he is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time remains ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  we are on the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis in the war on terror .,Democratic
we all are united in that war  but this is an immigration bill  and i do believe we should do immigration in a bipartisan manner .,Democratic
let me make it very clear  the 9/11 terrorists would not have been thwarted by this legislation .,Democratic
in fact  all 19 of the 9/11 hijackers had documents to enter the country legally .,Democratic
and under this particular legislation  the terrorists would not have been prevented from using these documents to obtain driver 's licenses .,Democratic
i think the real crux is as was quoted in the words of governor jeb bush  `` what do you do with them ?,Democratic
`` illegal aliens who are working in our hotels and factories  who are working every day in our states and our cities and our counties ?,Democratic
the last thing  mr.,Democratic
chairman : do we remember bosnia and kosovo ?,Democratic
these were people seeking asylum .,Democratic
i think we have to judge ourselves by reason and reasonable policy .,Democratic
i join my colleagues in working together to secure the homeland  but in this instance  this does not follow the 9/11 recommendations .,Democratic
this commission did  in fact  say that they wanted secure documents  and identification should begin in the united states .,Democratic
it did not document or indicate in which manner we should be able to do that .,Democratic
i would have hoped that h.r.,Democratic
620  the security measures feasibility act  which would ask the hard questions of how and what is the best vehicle in order to be able to establish these secure documents  would have been the better approach .,Democratic
now we undermine the states ' ability for safety and security in their own states  and we undermine the very principles of this nation  which are to open the doors for those fleeing persecution both in terms of religious and political persecution .,Democratic
what about the cubans ?,Democratic
what about the haitians  the liberians  the sudanese  the bosnians ?,Democratic
what about those fleeing  as my colleague has indicated  our jewish individuals who were fleeing persecution ?,Democratic
i simply say that we have a better way of doing this .,Democratic
i wish we could do it together .,Democratic
i hope my colleagues will oppose this bill so we might do this effort in a bipartisan manner .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act .,Democratic
the real id act is an attempt to breathe life into immigration provisions that were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act .,Democratic
these provisions were viewed as controversial then  and they are no less controversial now .,Democratic
the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to the floor .,Democratic
the supporters of the h.r.,Democratic
418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states .,Democratic
this fear has to be put into perspective .,Democratic
terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility  and it is not apparent why they would choose such a complicated  time consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states in any event .,Democratic
the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors .,Democratic
visitors ' visas only require a two-minute interview with an american consulate officer .,Democratic
the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay .,Democratic
this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum  which  among other things  require the applicant to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion .,Democratic
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act established a study to find out the extent to which terrorists are attempting to use our asylum laws to enter and remain in the united states and what weaknesses they are exploiting .,Democratic
we need to wait for that information before we consider any bills on revising our asylum laws .,Democratic
changes should be designed to deal specifically with weaknesses that we know are being exploited .,Democratic
the approach in the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof  which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum .,Democratic
for instance  in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be `` on account of '' one of the enumerated grounds  the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be `` a central reason for persecuting the applicant.,Democratic
'' in effect  the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor .,Democratic
it is not apparent how this would discourage terrorists from fabricating asylum claims .,Democratic
the only certainty is that it would make it more difficult for bona fide asylum seekers to meet their burden of proof .,Democratic
the unfairness of this approach is illustrated by a comment that the honorable sandra day o'connor made recently about the asylum laws of our country .,Democratic
she said : the united states offers protection in the form of asylum to individuals fleeing persecution in other nations .,Democratic
in most cases  however  asylum seekers find themselves alone  destitute and facing deportation .,Democratic
asylum law is governed by a labyrinth of statutes  regulations  and case law  but  unlike criminal defendants  only those asylum seekers who can afford to hire an attorney or who are fortunate enough to secure pro bono counsel are represented .,Democratic
the real id act would codify the standards that adjudicators use in making credibility findings in asylum proceedings .,Democratic
the codification would encourage adverse credibility findings against asylum applicants who can not produce corroborating evidence of their account  or whose demeanor is inconsistent with an immigration judge 's preconceived expectations .,Democratic
this can be very unfair .,Democratic
people fleeing persecution often lack the opportunity and the ability to secure the legal evidence needed to corroborate their claims  and demeanor is a function in some cases of cultural background rather than credibility .,Democratic
for instance  it is considered rude in some cultures to stare into another person 's eyes during a conversation  but the failure to look someone in the eyes indicates deception in this country .,Democratic
the real id act also would expand the categories of people who can be excluded or deported as a terrorist .,Democratic
the broad net this would create would ensnare innocent people who have made donations or been involved in some other way with organizations they did not know were terrorist organizations .,Democratic
the defense to removal on that basis would be to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you did not know  and should not reasonably have known  that the organization was a terrorist organization .,Democratic
this can be an impossible burden to meet .,Democratic
for instance  how would you prove by clear and convincing evidence that you did not notice a person who entered this room 5 minutes ago ?,Democratic
the real id act also includes sections on security measures for drivers ' licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
we have already enacted legislation to improve security measures for drivers ' licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act we just enacted requires the secretary of transportation  in consultation with the secretary of homeland security  to promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for driver 's licenses or personal identification cards issued by a state for use by federal agencies for identification purposes .,Democratic
before being published as proposed regulations  the standards would be subjected to a negotiated rule making committee that would include the affected stakeholders such as state elected officials and state motor vehicle departments .,Democratic
the recommendations of this committee are required to include an assessment of the benefits and the costs of the measures in the proposed regulations .,Democratic
in contrast  the real id act would impose specific requirements on the states now  without giving the states and the other stakeholders an opportunity to provide input on what these requirements should be  and without an assessment of the benefits and costs of the measures .,Democratic
if the security measures were to prove to be impossible or too costly to implement  it would require an act of congress to change them .,Democratic
before we can address the merits of the security measures that would be required by the real id act  we need answers to the following questions .,Democratic
( 1 ) are the states capable of establishing and implementing the security measures mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner is proposing ?,Democratic
for instance  his bill calls for two categories of drivers ' licenses  one for citizens and permanent residents and another for aliens who have nonimmigrant status .,Democratic
the licenses for nonimmigrants would be tied to periods of lawful status and extensions of the status .,Democratic
can the state motor vehicle departments handle this increased work load ?,Democratic
will the states be able to provide the training needed to evaluate the many immigration documents that reflect lawful nonimmigrant status ?,Democratic
( 2 ) how much would it cost to establish  implement  and maintain these security measures ?,Democratic
we do not have unlimited the real id act also would restrict the privilege of obtaining a driver 's license to aliens who have lawful status .,Democratic
my security measures feasibility act would establish a study of the consequences that would result from forcing millions of undocumented aliens to drive without drivers ' licenses .,Democratic
sheriff timothy bukowski of kankakee  illinois  has made an important observation on this matter .,Democratic
according to sheriff bukowski  the issuance of drivers ' licenses is a safety issue  not an immigration issue .,Democratic
i agree with sheriff bukowski  a driver 's license is more than just a privilege to the driver  it also is a device that the states use to make our highways safer .,Democratic
austin assistant chief of police rudy landerso explains it this way .,Democratic
`` [ w ] e strongly believe it would be in the public interest to make available to these communities the ability to obtain a driver 's license .,Democratic
in allowing this community the opportunity to obtain driver 's licenses  they will have to study our laws and pass a driver 's test that will make them not only informed drivers but safe drivers.,Democratic
'' i would just add that it also requires them to have insurance .,Democratic
the real id act contains a provision that would provide the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive all laws he deems necessary for the expeditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed by section 102 of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of 1996  iirira .,Democratic
to my knowledge  a waiver this broad is unprecedented .,Democratic
it would waive all laws  including laws protecting civil rights ; laws protecting the health and safety of workers ; laws  such as the davis-bacon act  which are intended to ensure that construction workers on federally-funded projects are paid the prevailing wage ; environmental laws ; and laws respecting sacred burial grounds .,Democratic
it so broad that it would not just apply to i am concerned also by the piecemeal approach that the real id act is taking to immigration reform .,Democratic
we need comprehensive immigration reform  not fixes for a few specific problems .,Democratic
this view is shared by our colleagues on the senate side .,Democratic
senator john mccain has expressed the need to have comprehensive immigration reform .,Democratic
i have heard that he will be working on comprehensive immigration legislation with senator edward kennedy .,Democratic
we can do the same thing in the house of representatives .,Democratic
i invite my colleagues who are supporting the real id act to work with me on comprehensive immigration reform .,Democratic
in the meantime  however  passage of this piece-meal  ill-advised bill would be a step backwards .,Democratic
i urge you to vote against it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  do i have time for a unanimous consent request ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  let me first of all say and repeat what i have said many times  that immigration does not equate to terrorism .,Democratic
also i have said just recently  this morning  that the immigration reform question is a bipartisan question .,Democratic
i also took note of the fact that if one were to take polling numbers  there obviously is an overwhelming impression that what we are addressing today is an immigration bill .,Democratic
certainly the sessions amendment deals more with immigration than it does with straight issues of terrorism  because there is no divide amongst the american people regarding securing the homeland .,Democratic
my concern with this legislation is procedural  but it is also a question of fairness .,Democratic
this is a serious departure from the normal trends that we have now expressed by the body of this congress and that is the establishment of the department of homeland security .,Democratic
this in fact takes homeland security responsibilities and actually outsources them .,Democratic
the reason this is so challenging is that the committee on homeland security  the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr.,Democratic
thompson ) xz4004021  the ranking member  have not had a chance to review this amendment .,Democratic
this amendment has had no hearings  and here we are talking about giving extraordinary powers to bondsmen .,Democratic
this means if you are an immigrant undocumented in removal proceedings working with a lawyer  working with family members  you are then dispatching bondspersons with no direct immigration training to round you up and immediately bring you to a point of deportation where you are in the middle of a legal process .,Democratic
if that is considered to be  one  a recommendation of the 9/11 commission  i would severely and strongly disagree .,Democratic
yes  individuals who are in line to be deported is an issue .,Democratic
we need more detention beds and more security at our borders  but we do not need to outsource to bondspersons  however financially opportunistic it may be  and as a former judge and someone who deals with these issues in my private practice before coming to congress  i realize bondspersons have their role  but not to contract out to deal with this issue .,Democratic
i know the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 has good intentions  but may i give a historical perspective  and that is of the 1850 fugitive slave act .,Democratic
the truly frightening part of this legislation is it smacks of that kind of effort .,Democratic
the fugitive slave act gave broad  virtually unfettered power to agents or slave owners to seize slaves in the free states and return or send them to slavery in the slave states  obviously with little regard for their legal status in free states with no due process and opportunity to defend themselves .,Democratic
that was 1850 .,Democratic
if we randomly give the opportunity to bondsmen who have no understanding of immigration laws  we can be assured that in a discriminatory fashion they will be rounding up people who look different and speak different languages  and we will be impacted in a very negative way .,Democratic
i close by saying all of us in our congressional districts hear the hardship cases of immigrants who are seeking legal status who have been in line for long times who have had terrible things happen to them because of the complexity of the immigration system .,Democratic
that speaks for comprehensive immigration reform  but those are the very victims  those sad cases  that are going to be impacted by this amendment .,Democratic
i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman sessions has offered .,Democratic
this amendment would empower bail bondsman to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people .,Democratic
it would outsource an important government immigration enforcement responsibility to the bail bonds industry  eliminating the few procedural due process rights immigrants have when challenging deportation .,Democratic
this would be a dramatic change in how we arrest and detain people in removal proceedings .,Democratic
many people rounded up in this manner would turn out not to be deportable after all .,Democratic
they may be u.s. citizens ; they may not be removable under the grounds charged ; or they may be eligible for some form of relief .,Democratic
yet this policy would treat them all as criminals .,Democratic
i am particularly disturbed by the fact that these dramatic policy changes have never been reviewed or examined by a congressional committee .,Democratic
there were no hearings .,Democratic
no debate occurred .,Democratic
no scrutiny at all .,Democratic
in fact  the language of this amendment was only recently made available .,Democratic
without committee scrutiny  we would be giving bonding agents vast  unfettered authority to pursue  apprehend  detain and surrender immigrants -- even when the bond is not breached .,Democratic
this is a certain recipe for misconduct  mistakes and the trampling of civil  due process and human rights .,Democratic
without committee scrutiny  we would be allowing bonding agents to decide when people are flight risks and to round them up and hand them over to dhs for deportation .,Democratic
without committee scrutiny we would be permitting bonds to be forfeited and people deported for not notifying dhs of changes of address prior to a move -- even though dhs regulations give immigrants 10 days after a move to notify the agency of the change .,Democratic
without committee scrutiny  we would be allowing bonding agents to have open access to all information held by the u.s. government or any state or local government that may be helpful in locating or surrendering the person who is the subject of the bond .,Democratic
without committee scrutiny  we would be compelling the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information to a bonding agent  such as : medical history ; criminal investigation notes  location of witnesses  and information on victims of domestic violence .,Democratic
i urge you to vote against this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr.,Democratic
thompson ) xz4004021  the newly appointed ranking member of the committee on homeland security .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
filner ) xz4001330  who has been able to determine the difference between immigration laws and laws to fight terrorism ; and also his district contains the discussed fence .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i believe that what we do today is a matter that could have been approached in a bipartisan manner .,Democratic
as i look at the members on the floor of the house  each and every one is sincere in their commitment to the war on terrorism .,Democratic
and let me applaud them for that .,Democratic
i applaud the chairman of the full committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
let me applaud the ranking member .,Democratic
a number of members who are here on the floor are committee on the judiciary members .,Democratic
i want to applaud them for the work that has been done on this issue .,Democratic
that is why i believe that the real id act could have been addressed in regular order  the regular order of committee hearings  the regular order of taking testimony from governors and legislators and local government officials .,Democratic
but now the real id act is an attempt to breathe life into immigration provisions that were stripped from the terrorism reform and prevention act .,Democratic
these provisions were viewed as controversial then and they are no less controversial now .,Democratic
opposition to this legislation at this time is by no means a reflection on anyone 's commitment to the war on terrorism  but the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to this floor .,Democratic
first of all  it is an unfunded mandate of almost $ 500 million .,Democratic
supporters of h.r.,Democratic
418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states .,Democratic
this fear has to be put into perspective .,Democratic
terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility  and it is not apparent why they should choose such a complicated  time-consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states  in any event .,Democratic
in addition  large numbers of advocates  religious organizations and others who understand asylum laws and realize that there are still religious and political persecution today  realize that this bill is misdirected .,Democratic
as we stand here on the floor  the committee on rules is determining whether the nadler amendment will be admitted that responds to the crisis we face in the asylum laws if this bill is to be passed in its present form .,Democratic
we know that the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors .,Democratic
visitor visas only require a 2-minute interview with an american consulate office .,Democratic
the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay .,Democratic
this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum .,Democratic
i too want to have a kind of organized system that bars terrorists  but putting into effect a national id card is not what the 9/11 commission said .,Democratic
in fact  they made it very clear .,Democratic
this legislation will force the united states in its national database and in its requirement standardizing id driver 's licenses and birth certificates which puts us on that road without hearings  without oversight  and without question of america 's civil liberties .,Democratic
i know that the polls and all the phone calls in members ' offices have said we do not want illegal aliens driving cars .,Democratic
well  do you want individuals on our highways and byways that are not licensed ?,Democratic
are you taking away the 10th amendment of the united states to allow them to be able to standardize those documents ?,Democratic
i do believe that we can standardize them by a biometric system  but we have intruded on the rights of states when they too can work with the federal government making the system work .,Democratic
i think there are valuable aspects of this bill ; not using certain id for certain federal purposes  which may in fact include travel .,Democratic
but the overbroadness of this particular legislation  barring any laws to be utilized in the building of a fence  eliminating environmental laws  work laws  criminal laws is overbroad .,Democratic
lastly  i would say  we are the land of the free and the brave .,Democratic
we have always welcomed those fleeing from persecution .,Democratic
this legislation bars that opportunity  and i would ask my colleagues to oppose it and for us to go back to the drawing board and work for freedom and the war against terrorism in a bipartisan way .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
first of all  let me also refer my colleagues to the 9/11 commission report .,Democratic
what it said is that there were certain systems that needed improving or were broken .,Democratic
they suggested no such solution that the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 has offered .,Democratic
we need to strengthen the department of homeland security to be able to do its job  but more importantly  we need to be able to build those detention beds  thousands  if we will  to be able to have those that might be dangerous placed in detention locations .,Democratic
this amendment does not solve that problem at all .,Democratic
the arresting and gathering up of those who might be deported  clearly with no place to go  makes a bigger and worse problem than we might have .,Democratic
i would ask my colleagues to consider this not well directed and ask them to vote `` no. '' mr.,Democratic
chairman  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
conyers ) xz4000800 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
let me make a point that i think should be very clear .,Democratic
this legislation will not just impact those who are undocumented .,Democratic
this legislation will impact those immigrants who have legal status .,Democratic
in the process of reviewing or revising that status  they too become part of the large webbed fishnet of hauling people in by people who are inexperienced in this area .,Democratic
so i would offer to my colleagues that this is random  it is reckless  and it needs a bipartisan look and oversight committee assessment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i appreciate the clarification offered by the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Democratic
castle ) xz4000700 .,Democratic
i would inquire of the author of the amendment  one question : in your research  did we determine that dhs  new as it is  is not doing that ?,Democratic
that is the first question .,Democratic
on the second  let me have the gentleman restate it again .,Democratic
because one of the concerns i have on the select committee on homeland security and watching  for example  tsa formulate itself and work to train certainly very professional employees  but the training does not necessarily lend itself to maybe the keenness of eye to see that false document .,Democratic
we obviously have to improve .,Democratic
i was concerned as to whether or not it is the spotting of someone  saying you have a false driver 's license  or can you restate that it is actually going through a judicial system with a conviction  determining that is what you ultimately did ?,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from delaware .,Democratic
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  let me pointedly ask the gentleman  you speak specifically to a judicial conviction going through  as opposed to being tapped and saying  you are carrying a false driver 's license .,Democratic
the gentleman is talking about actually trial and conviction ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment on this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response .,Democratic
one of the concerns i have is that we do not know whether dhs is doing this or what tsa is doing and hearings would have been appropriate .,Democratic
this is a valid issue  let us not doubt that ; and  of course  i would hope that we would want a database to be secured .,Democratic
i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random  making sure there is a conviction  and in knowing what happens with dhs .,Democratic
i would have wanted to have hearings  but i thank the gentleman for his answers .,Democratic
mr. chairman  clearly this amendment has good intentions  and i think it is important to note that the amendment would require the secretary of homeland security to enter into an aviation security database the name and other information about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license for the purpose of boarding an airplane .,Democratic
the objective of this amendment is to enhance our ability to track and detect potential security threats  and as i indicated  i support the objective .,Democratic
i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of the department of homeland security to have information in his database about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license .,Democratic
but as they all say  the devil is in the details .,Democratic
again  the same predicament or affliction that impacted the amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
sessions ) xz4003670 impacts this .,Democratic
where is the hearing ?,Democratic
where is the oversight ?,Democratic
where is the impact that will occur ?,Democratic
do these also include individuals who mistakenly have such a driver 's license  if that may be the case  and where is the basis for it ?,Democratic
i was just looking at a letter from commissioner hamilton  who talked about controversial provisions that everyone suggests came out of the 9/11 commission  and what he said very carefully was that these are  in fact  recommendations .,Democratic
as the intelligence bill did in the last session with enormous vetting  hearings  oversight  conference committees at the later stage  it almost became a hearing  none of these amendments have been given the kind of vetting that one would know that these are valuable and that the details have been worked out as to how we utilize the database or who gets into the database if  by chance  the utilization was a mistake even though they violated the law .,Democratic
so you create this enormous database that has those who potentially would do us harm  but others  unfortunately  that got themselves into the criminal justice system .,Democratic
we hope  however  that this amendment will send notice to those who might try to use any false document in trying to get on an airplane for the potential damage it may do .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman castle has offered .,Democratic
this amendment would require the secretary of homeland security to enter into an aviation security database the name and other information about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license for the purpose of boarding an airplane .,Democratic
the objective of this amendment is to enhance our ability to track and detect potential security threats .,Democratic
i support this objective  and i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of homeland security to have information in his data bases about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license .,Democratic
as they say  however  `` the devil is in the details.,Democratic
'' i would like a hearing and a markup on this amendment before deciding whether it should be enacted .,Democratic
i urge you to vote against the castle amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from michigan .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  let me just close by raising these points .,Democratic
it looks like we are moving quite quickly .,Democratic
it is the question of having the answers .,Democratic
this has good intentions  but the answers of what dhs is doing  the training of tsa  what kind of standards are used in different airports .,Democratic
some tsa person might say it is a mistake  go back .,Democratic
others might make it in essence a federal crime and that person is prosecuted .,Democratic
so some you get in the database  others you do not .,Democratic
it is just a question of concern as to how this will work .,Democratic
again  it is a good idea .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of the kolbe amendment .,Democratic
i also thank my colleague  the distinguished gentlewoman from california  for yielding me this time and  as well  my colleague and friend  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
ortiz ) xz4003020 .,Democratic
let me express my appreciation for his leadership  because we have spent a good amount of time together at the southern border .,Democratic
i have also spent a good deal of time at the northern border  both sides of the coast .,Democratic
clearly  this legislation is needed with respect to improved and increased technology  but i would also argue that the secure our border act  that was offered by the select committee on homeland security democrats in the last congress  really speaks to the broader question .,Democratic
and  frankly  i wish this amendment had gone a step further ; that is that what we do not have are the necessary border patrol agents and their training equal to the enormous responsibility that comes with people coming across the border and  as well  adding that to the technology that is part of this particular amendment .,Democratic
and then  of course  detention beds .,Democratic
the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
ortiz ) xz4003020 is absolutely right .,Democratic
the southern border now lends itself to the doorway of terrorism because of this concept of otms  and the idea that they are given just a piece of paper  as he said  that says  show up  and no one is required to show up ; or when i say  required  there is no pressure  no enforcement  of their showing up .,Democratic
so technology is certainly what we need  and i hope  as we move forward in the select committee on homeland security  we will  if you will  author bills that will give those resources to the northern and southern border .,Democratic
but we need to understand what the gentleman is saying .,Democratic
this is a crisis as it relates to otms  particularly dealing with the potential of using that border for terrorists to come across .,Democratic
technology is one thing  but human participation is another ; not what has been offered by the president 's budget of 200 border patrol agents  but the 2  000 that really will help us secure the borders as necessary .,Democratic
this amendment will go a long way .,Democratic
i rise in support of the kolbe amendment .,Democratic
the kolbe amendment is one of the few ideas that have been proposed on the floor of the house during debate on h.r.,Democratic
418 that would help secure our borders .,Democratic
we must secure our land borders and putting 21st century technology to work for us is the heart of the solution .,Democratic
homeland security democrats support monitoring our borders 24 hours a day -- 7 days a week .,Democratic
while the kolbe amendment falls short of asking for an interagency border security strategy  as democrats did in the secure border act  it does get at the key issues of assessing technology and staffing .,Democratic
now that congress has passed laws increasing personnel and technology  what we need most is an evaluation of what it will take to secure out borders .,Democratic
additionally  while sensors and cameras are currently being used  simple deployment is n't always the answer .,Democratic
the solution must address the problem and take into consideration the terrain .,Democratic
a ground surveillance program in partnership with the remote aerial surveillance program which was mandated as part of the 9/11 bill will go a long way towards achieving real border security .,Democratic
one missing area element in this amendment seems to be a link between the air and ground surveillance programs .,Democratic
i hope that that 's addressed .,Democratic
we can not afford to build systems in isolation .,Democratic
lastly  while this amendment does add to the debate on border security  these surveillance systems still require border patrol agents to apprehend illegal border crossers and contraband .,Democratic
when homeland security committee staff visited the southern border last year during a six month investigation  they found and heard border patrol agents tell them that they are inadequately staffed to monitor the expansive southern border .,Democratic
one border patrol support staffer explained that staffing shortages meant that he was responsible for simultaneously viewing 26 cameras for illegal crossings and notifying agents when he saw any crossings .,Democratic
this same employee was also responsible for notifying agents about buried sensor activations numbering from 100-150 an hour  and running computer checks on all detainees .,Democratic
it is clear that despite the fact that we have increased border patrol numbers  border patrol still lacks critical support staff .,Democratic
funding border security is a critical component of securing america 's borders .,Democratic
if the president wo n't do it -- let 's make sure that congress does .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i can not help before i begin to join with my colleague  the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
wolf ) xz4004350  to say that we absolutely can not strike those vital funds for peacekeeping .,Democratic
but  mr.,Democratic
chairman  i rise today  as well as to support those peacekeeping dollars  to say that many of the efforts in this legislation  the work that has been done by the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 and the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391  i can appreciate in this emergency supplemental  even though as i have spoken to my good friend and leader  the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860  on this issue  it is important that we have an announced success strategy for leaving iraq .,Democratic
remember what i said  a success strategy  and i have not yet heard that from the administration .,Democratic
but i rise today to comment that the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the $ 81.3 billion in this bill is really spent wisely .,Democratic
i think we could have done better .,Democratic
i am very disturbed as the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration  border security  and claims that we have now forced into this bill as a self-operating part of the rule that h.r.,Democratic
418 would be included in the engrossment of the underlying bill  h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
i opposed the republican leadership 's position to attach the real id act to this emergency supplemental .,Democratic
this is anti-immigrant legislation that will not make us safer .,Democratic
rather  it scapegoats asylum seekers and other immigrants .,Democratic
last year  congress passed new driver 's license standards in the 9/11 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support  and i do support that .,Democratic
it was a good bill  and the intelligence reform bill was supported in a bipartisan manner .,Democratic
but we do not need to undo the careful compromise and thought processes by imposing anti-immigrant policies onto states ' driver 's licenses and identification processes .,Democratic
where is the money ?,Democratic
this is an unfunded mandate .,Democratic
what is a state going to do if they are not able to implement these new procedures because they do not have the money ?,Democratic
the bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these ill-conceived policies .,Democratic
we have had no hearings on this real id legislation  and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in h. res.,Democratic
151 .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees  imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states  making it easier to deport legal immigrants  legal immigrants  waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers where we have been told by homeland security experts they will not make us safer anywhere in the united states  and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights .,Democratic
i believe those who are criminals need to be incarcerated  but there are immigrants who are standing in line trying to achieve citizenship .,Democratic
if reenacted into this legislation  it will yet again threaten to close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution and women fleeing sex trafficking  rape and forced abortions .,Democratic
in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy  and even after the patriot act  this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible .,Democratic
at some point we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an `` intelligence '' response  as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants .,Democratic
an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsunami victims  our troops in iraq and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of the real id act .,Democratic
i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe  to provide relief to victims of the tsunami in southeast asia and africa  and to provide security in afghanistan ; but this is a poison pill .,Democratic
i look forward to supporting the jackson amendment .,Democratic
i will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding on the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs .,Democratic
but we need to take this real id out of it so we can have a good bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of some of the efforts funded in this emergency supplemental  h.r.,Democratic
1268  although the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would both provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the $ 81.3 billion proposed in this bill is spent wisely .,Democratic
of particular concern to me as ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration  border security  and claims  is the forced inclusion of h.r.,Democratic
418 in the engrossment of the underlying bill  h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
i oppose the republican leadership 's decision to attach the real id act to this emergency supplemental .,Democratic
this anti-immigrant legislation will not make us safer -- rather  it scapegoats asylum-seekers and other immigrants .,Democratic
last year  congress passed new driver 's license standards in the 9/11 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support .,Democratic
we do not need to undo that careful compromise by imposing anti-immigrant policies onto states ' driver 's license and identification processes .,Democratic
this bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these ill-conceived policies .,Democratic
we have had no hearings on this bill  and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in the rule  h. res.,Democratic
151 .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees  imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states  making it easier to deport legal immigrants  waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states  and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights .,Democratic
if re-enacted into this legislation it will yet again threaten to close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution ; and women fleeing sex trafficking  rape  and forced abortions .,Democratic
in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy  and even after the patriot act  this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible .,Democratic
at some point  we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an `` intelligence '' response  as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants .,Democratic
an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsumani victims  our troops in iraq  and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of real id .,Democratic
inclusion in this fashion amounts to a forced acceptance of its provisions much like a contract of adhesion .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe  to provide relief to victims of the tsunamis in southeast asia and africa  and to provide security for afghanistan .,Democratic
however  the legislation before us today stands to use the public 's fear of terrorism to radically change asylum law for all asylees  not just those with some connection to terrorism or relating to the issues contained in the underlying legislation .,Democratic
for these reasons  i oppose this legislation in its present form .,Democratic
i will  however  support the jackson amendment on africa and i as well  will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding of the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs  a real crucial part of the nation 's homeland security .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer an amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i recognize the importance of having standardized drivers ' licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
this should be done on a bipartisan basis  however .,Democratic
the real id act was not bipartisan  and it was moved too quickly through the legislative process .,Democratic
it was passed without any committee hearings or markups .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 .,Democratic
i thank him for protecting so many of our constitutional rights .,Democratic
mr. chairman  let me say that the asylum laws  as i was reminded by my good and dear colleague from florida  started in world war ii when we were reminded of the ugly scene of turning away the st .,Democratic
louis  the 1  000 jews who were fleeing persecution .,Democratic
let me just suggest that we do have an opportunity to review this issue and make it right  but i can tell you that commissioner kean and commissioner hamilton indicated that in advocating that these are recommendations of the 9/11 commission ; these are not recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
there is no proof or facts that terrorists have been able to pull one over on us in large numbers .,Democratic
it is very important to let the comptroller general 's study go forward that evaluates the extent to which weaknesses in the united states ' asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists .,Democratic
we need to understand this .,Democratic
i do not expect that the report will show that that is happening .,Democratic
it is extremely important that we realize that the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors .,Democratic
they were not individuals who sought asylum .,Democratic
let me correct my good friends about the 1993 bombing .,Democratic
these individuals sought asylum  but they were denied asylum .,Democratic
there is not a crisis here ; but what is a crisis is when you turn people away from our shores who have come here downtrodden  who are seeking asylum because of religious persecution  because of mutilation of women  because of enormous child abuse or potentially child soldiers  and you turn them away because they do not look like you and because  in fact  they can not make their case .,Democratic
i would ask my colleagues to consider opposing this amendment .,Democratic
i rise in support of the amendment that i have offered with my colleagues representatives nadler and meek .,Democratic
it would strike section 101 of h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act  which is entitled  `` preventing terrorists from obtaining relief from removal.,Democratic
'' notwithstanding that title  the provisions in section 101 codify evidentiary standards for asylum proceedings .,Democratic
the supporters of section 101 believe that terrorists are gaming our asylum system to enter and remain in the united states .,Democratic
it is not clear that terrorists actually are gaming our asylum system .,Democratic
section 5403 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act requires the comptroller general to conduct a study to evaluate the extent to which weaknesses in the united states asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists .,Democratic
we need to wait until this study is completed before we rewrite our asylum laws .,Democratic
we can not correct weaknesses that have not been identified yet .,Democratic
i do not expect that report to show that terrorists are gaming our asylum system .,Democratic
the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors .,Democratic
visitors ' visas are easy to get .,Democratic
it only requires a 2-minute interview with an american consulate officer to get a visitor 's visa .,Democratic
the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay .,Democratic
moreover  it would be naive to think that terrorist organizations do not have ready access to fraudulent entry documents .,Democratic
in contrast  it is difficult and time consuming to enter the united states as an asylum applicant .,Democratic
the terrorist choosing this method would have to present himself at a border and then prove in expedited removal proceedings that he has a credible fear of persecution on account of race  the approach taken by the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof for everyone who applies for asylum  which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum .,Democratic
in fact  terrorist organizations are in a much better position to fabricate evidence of persecution than the typical bona fide asylum applicant who has fled his country in fear for his life without any thought of meeting evidentiary standards at an asylum hearing .,Democratic
for instance  in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be `` on account of ' one of the enumerated grounds  the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be `` a central reason for persecuting the applicant.,Democratic
'' in effect  the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor .,Democratic
section 101 has a subsection entitled  `` credibility determinations.,Democratic
'' it states that the trier of fact should consider all relevant factors .,Democratic
this is fine  unnecessary but fine .,Democratic
then it provides that the trier of fact has the discretion of basing a credibility determination on any relevant factor  and it specifies relevant factors that can be the sole basis for a credibility determination .,Democratic
near the end it mentions inconsistencies and inaccuracies or falsehoods in statements  `` without regard to whether an inconsistency  inaccuracy  or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant 's claim.,Democratic
'' in other words  it permits an immigration judge to make an adverse credibility finding in asylum proceedings on the basis of an inconsistency  inaccuracy  or falsehood that has no relevance to the asylum applicant 's persecution claim .,Democratic
what has this got to do with preventing terrorists from obtaining relief from removal ?,Democratic
i urge you to vote for this amendment to strike section 101 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
i want to rise as well to support the gentlewoman from new york 's amendment dealing with the efforts the unfpa is engaged in because we got a chance to see firsthand in visiting sri lanka the work that has been done .,Democratic
it is true that many children were lost .,Democratic
it is true that 15  000  at the time that we were there  women were expecting ; and it is certainly true that they lost a large infrastructure of health care  particularly the women 's hospital that we were able to visit .,Democratic
the women 's maternity hospital was completely destroyed  and so these dollars will be crucial in helping to ensure good health care  good intervention  and safe deliveries .,Democratic
i want to commend all of the leadership that is focused on this particularly narrow issue  though it may seem .,Democratic
it is vital that we provide the support  and i would like to encourage our colleagues to support this amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise sadly to oppose the emergency supplemental because of the horrific and ill-advised immigration provisions and the lack of oversight that has been given to the provisions in this section .,Democratic
i hope we will have an opportunity to address this in a comprehensive manner .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today very conflicted over a piece of vital legislation for which this entire body should really be in solidarity .,Democratic
the conference report on h.r.,Democratic
1268 provides for emergency fy2005 funds for military operations in iraq and afghanistan  tsunami relief efforts  foreign assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorities .,Democratic
however  this legislation also includes an insidious section with provisions of h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act  which has nothing to do with what should be the real intent of this emergency supplemental .,Democratic
instead of being united on issues of national security and international relations  we are put in a divisive situation with the provisions of the real id act .,Democratic
the issues of importance addressed by this emergency supplemental do not give rise to a need to include provisions from h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act -- legislation for which congress has not held a legislative hearing  markup  nor full debate in the house .,Democratic
just last year  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempted to force these provisions in the context of the 9/11 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act  h.r.,Democratic
10 .,Democratic
the sponsor of the real id act 's driver 's license provisions would have gone far beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
the 9/11 commission did not suggest that the standards should be federally mandated without state participation  that a database should be created to share personal identification information  that undocumented immigrants should be prevented from getting licenses or that non-citizens should get an identifiably different driver 's license .,Democratic
finally  none of the real id act sponsor 's provisions have been reviewed by the congress or the commission .,Democratic
there have been no hearings or debates on these significant changes to existing law .,Democratic
the immigration provisions that have been forced into this supplemental include numerous provisions restricting the grant of asylum `` protection  imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states  making it easier to deport legal immigrants  waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states  and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights .,Democratic
the usa patriot act  for which we in the subcommittee on crime  terrorism  and homeland security of the judiciary are only now holding hearings in piecemeal form  already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection in the united states .,Democratic
none of the people associated with recent attacks  or plans for terrorist attacks in the u.s.  were here under grants of asylum .,Democratic
instead  these changes will make it harder for people legitimately fleeing persecution to prove their asylum claims and gain protection here .,Democratic
bona fide refugees who can not meet the higher standards will be returned to countries where they were persecuted  possibly to face terror  torture and death .,Democratic
the forced provisions will set a dangerous legal precedent by requiring the government to waive all federal  state and local laws to build barriers and fences to deter illegal entry into the united states .,Democratic
this waiver would require violating laws that protect sacred native american burial sites  important environmental regions  and the wages of laborers .,Democratic
yet this policy is unnecessary .,Democratic
in the 9-11 act  we passed language to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the systematic surveillance of the southwest border by remotely piloted aircraft and other electronic means .,Democratic
we can preserve our legal rights and regimes and still secure our nation .,Democratic
the great majority of this emergency supplemental  a sum of $ 75.9 billion goes towards u.s. military operations in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
in this conference report 's military spending total of $ 75.9 billion includes $ 37.1 billion for military operations and maintenance spending  $ 17.4 billion for personnel  and $ 17.4 billion for new weapons procurement .,Democratic
i am very pleased to say that this conference report increases the military death gratuity to $ 100  000  from $ 12  420  and increases subsidized life insurance benefits to $ 400  000  from $ 250  000  for families of soldiers who died or were killed while on active duty beginning from oct .,Democratic
7  2001 .,Democratic
i can not describe how fundamental it is that we take care of our armed forces and their loved ones .,Democratic
this conference report addresses some of the concerns that democrats have had about the fact that the families of soldiers who were killed while on active duty were not being given the necessary funds to provide for themselves .,Democratic
in addition  this conference report provides $ 308 million more than requested for add-on vehicle armor kits ; large increases for new trucks ; added funds for night-vision equipment ; and $ 60 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents as i stated there are many provisions of this emergency supplemental in which this body can be united in agreement .,Democratic
one such issue is the tsunami relief provided in this emergency supplemental .,Democratic
the conference report before us today appropriates $ 907 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by the dec .,Democratic
26  2004  earthquake and tsunami .,Democratic
in addition  this measure also provides $ 226 million to reimburse the u.s. military for expenses incurred in providing emergency relief to the tsunami victims  and $ 25 million to build and deploy 35 new tsunami-detection buoys in the pacific  atlantic  the caribbean and the gulf of mexico to provide warning to communities of approaching tsunamis .,Democratic
i had the opportunity to see the damage caused by the tsunami when i visited sri lanka with my colleagues led by mr.,Democratic
crowley shortly after the tsunami disaster .,Democratic
i had the opportunity to visit with usaid personnel who were there trying to aid the sri lankan people in rebuilding their nation .,Democratic
i have to say the attitude of our american personel and the smiles they brought to the face of the sri lankan people would make every member of this congress very proud .,Democratic
we talk about public diplomacy with the international world and i firmly believe that the funds appropriated here along with the work of our personnel on the ground help make a great case for the goodness of our nation .,Democratic
i am also similarly pleased that about $ 400 million in this conference report will go towards humanitarian assistance in darfur  sudan .,Democratic
i recently had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in neighboring chad where thousands of sudanese in darfur have fled to escape the conflict .,Democratic
needless to say  i was able to confirm from eyewitness accounts that the conflict in darfur is indeed even more shocking and deeply disturbing in its viciousness than has been reported to us .,Democratic
we as a nation must stand against such brutality and the funds in this emergency supplemental will help to ease the suffering of those involved in this conflict .,Democratic
in addition  this conference report includes $ 920 million for all peacekeeping programs  many of which are in sudan .,Democratic
however  while i have always been a strong again  i am in general support of the goals proposed by h.r.,Democratic
1268  but i am troubled by the implications of the supplemental appropriations measure that this body is poised to pass that relate to immigration policy .,Democratic
the underlying legislation proposes to fund important needs that pertain to operation iraqi freedom ; operation enduring freedom  in afghanistan ; army and marine corps restructuring ; recapitalization and replacement of equipment ; and replenishment of cash balances in certain working capital funds .,Democratic
in truth  this emergency supplemental funds many needed priorities  but it is the one issue of the real id act  which is not a priority  that poisons this legislation .,Democratic
will the gentleman yield for just a moment ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in favor of the farr amendment .,Democratic
this bill gives the secretary unprecedented authority to waive all laws to finish the construction of the security barrier .,Democratic
this bill denies due process to anyone challenging the secretary 's decision by prohibiting judicial review of the secretary 's waivers .,Democratic
these provisions would undermine the federal trust responsibility to indian nations by allowing waivers of federal requirements of providing tribal notification that are specifically designed to protect native american burial grounds  religious shrines  and cultural and historical sites .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to support the farr amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in reluctant support for the $ 81.1 billion emergency supplemental funding bill we are considering today .,Democratic
the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater  increases death gratuity to $ 100  000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty .,Democratic
my support for this measure is tepid at best .,Democratic
what troubles me the most about this bill are two key concerns : one  there are no mechanisms for tracking if the money is properly spent .,Democratic
there is simply no mechanism for improving accountability of how taxpayers ' dollars are spent .,Democratic
the defense department wants to take the money and provide little detail to congress on how these dollars are being used or abused .,Democratic
the american people have a right to know how these dollars are spent .,Democratic
and  two  by increasing investments in our war and defense efforts  we further constrain budgetary resources for investments in education  highways  community development  first responders  health care  public health and more .,Democratic
what is at stake here is the very welfare of our states and communities  who find themselves financially strapped because of the economic policies of this administration .,Democratic
our domestic economy can not continue to pursue this trend .,Democratic
despite my many misgivings over this spending bill  i will vote for its passage .,Democratic
we in congress must call on the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment  and frankly think it would be irresponsible not to vote for the tierney amendment .,Democratic
all the gentleman is asking for is fiscal accountability on over $ 200 billion that is being spent far beyond these shores .,Democratic
the gentleman is asking for accountability .,Democratic
to not pass the tierney amendment is to be fiscally irresponsible and to continue to be unaccountable to the taxpayers of this country .,Democratic
let me remind members  the amount of money we have now spent in iraq is over $ 200 billion .,Democratic
we do more checking on the books of churches around this country than we do on the expenditure of $ 200 billion .,Democratic
according to a 2003 gao report  `` iraq appears to be the first case where the united states government has used private contractors extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or hostile situations.,Democratic
'' indeed  it is estimated there are as many as 20  000 private military personnel in iraq .,Democratic
what are they all doing ?,Democratic
why are private companies protecting some of the highest level officials we have there rather than our u.s. military ?,Democratic
who is writing those contracts ?,Democratic
what about abu ghraib ?,Democratic
what kind of contract was struck there ?,Democratic
what kind of accountability existed ?,Democratic
well  it did not  why not ?,Democratic
we ought to be investigating as a nation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  what happens with $ 200 billion  our people have a right to know .,Democratic
never have we had a military conflict where so many private contractors are involved .,Democratic
we should be concerned about this and concerned about who is writing these contracts .,Democratic
a recently congressional quarterly article indicated  `` neither the defense department nor private industry says it has exact numbers of how many people are on private payrolls under contracts paid by u.s. tax dollars.,Democratic
'' we should do what is right with the money of the american people .,Democratic
there does not appear to be any legal framework in place to handle and deal with the role of nonmilitary personnel in a war zone .,Democratic
indeed  the liability of contractors who violate the law operating in iraq  afghanistan  and guantanamo bay is ambiguous so we have more responsibility to have strong oversight over these dollars that are being expended .,Democratic
i can not think of a better amendment to pass than this one .,Democratic
federal procurement data suggests that money allocated to military contractors via federal procurement has jumped by more than $ 70 billion in the last 3 fiscal years .,Democratic
someone here should care .,Democratic
we should do what we would do within our own families and look at every single line in these accounts .,Democratic
there is an awful lot of slippage .,Democratic
in january  the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction reported that the coalition provisional authority could not account for over $ 8.8 billion .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to commend the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 for doing what is right  what is fiscally responsible  what provides the accountability that we have responsibility for .,Democratic
i heard another reference on the radio this morning that iraq is going to be a generational commitment like world war ii was .,Democratic
if we are going to spend that kind of money  we ought to make doggone sure that every dollar is properly accounted for .,Democratic
i was pretty upset when i saw big photos of big stacks of money being handed out on the streets over there .,Democratic
i asked one of the top generals the other day if we are paying for the training of the iraqi national guard and these troops that are supposed to replace our troops .,Democratic
he said  no  congresswoman  someone else is paying for that .,Democratic
i am still looking and want to know who is paying for some of these units .,Democratic
i say congratulations to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070  who has an uphill struggle here .,Democratic
but he is doing what is right for america in order to make sure that we are responsible to the taxpayer and accountable for every single dollar being expended .,Democratic
please support the tierney amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my understanding of an emergency supplemental is to deal with emergency funding situations in the government .,Democratic
i realize that the present language speaks directly to coast guard  which is part of now the department of homeland security .,Democratic
this amendment amends that section and asks and has a viable offset and asks simply to allow $ 40 million of that amount to be able to be utilized for the underfunded ice agents that do not have uniforms  that do not have badges  that do not have ids .,Democratic
frankly  i believe if we are to do our work in iraq  whether we agree or disagree with the war in iraq  we do know that it is represented to us by the administration to be a war on terror .,Democratic
how can we fight the war on terror in afghanistan and iraq and not fight the war on terror in this country within our boundaries ?,Democratic
the immigration customs and enforcement helps us do that .,Democratic
it separates out those who intend to do us harm from those who are here who may be undocumented but are here simply for economic reasons .,Democratic
we need to be able to thwart those who may come across the border to do us harm and are not caught at the border .,Democratic
we need to be able to have the agency well equipped to protect us by securing those individuals and detaining them .,Democratic
without those resources they can not even continue .,Democratic
do not take my word .,Democratic
take the word of admiral loy  who indicated that they needed more dollars to finish out the fiscal year in question .,Democratic
i would ask my colleague  and i would also ask at this moment  that if he pursues his point of order  whether or not we will have the opportunity  whether in conference or as we continue the appropriations process  to focus on the lack of funding for the immigration and enforcement officers  immigration  customs and enforcement officers  the border patrol  which i think you are aware of  and the detention beds .,Democratic
i would like very much to yield to the chairman  and on this issue i think we are all in common agreement about the need to secure our homeland .,Democratic
mr. chairman  let me acknowledge the full committee and the members of the appropriate subcommittee dealing with homeland security and  as well  the full committee chairman 's just recent statement on this issue .,Democratic
but mr.,Democratic
chairman  i would hope that if a point of order is in order  i would hope that that point of order could be waived .,Democratic
and let me share with you why .,Democratic
this amendment is a very narrow amendment  very limited in its request .,Democratic
but it is documented and based upon testimony given by the very principals who are entrusted with the responsibility of homeland security .,Democratic
former outgoing dhs deputy secretary james loy indicated that in testimony to the house appropriations subcommittee on homeland security  that ice  the immigration  customs and enforcement  needed an additional 300 million in order to finish the fiscal year 2004 .,Democratic
this is an emergency .,Democratic
officer callahan came before the judiciary committee just a few days ago on march 10 and indicated that in 5 days we might see the closing of the operations of ice .,Democratic
that is the internal enforcement agency that deals with protecting the homeland internally .,Democratic
now  i have stood on the floor of this house over and over again  and i have said that immigration does not equate to terrorism .,Democratic
there are hard working individuals who are undocumented in this country who clearly have come here for economic reasons .,Democratic
but we also know that coming across the southern border there are what we call otms  other than mexicans  and they come across the border .,Democratic
they are not detained .,Democratic
they are given a document to retain to come back to court for a court date  and they are released on their own recognizance .,Democratic
and do you realize that many of them  some who are coming from countries that have terrorist activities and attitudes toward the united states  and they are able to come up through the southern border  cross into the united states with absolutely no punitive measures whatsoever .,Democratic
why ?,Democratic
because we are shortened at the border and we are shortened in terms of immigration enforcement inside the country  and there are no detention beds .,Democratic
and so i rise today to be able to submit an amendment to ask for $ 40 million  that is all  to be able to carry this entity for a few more days and to be able to respond to the need for more immigration  customs and enforcement officers .,Democratic
immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice 's financial difficulties  and i realize that there is still a need to be able to fix the financial problems at ice .,Democratic
but fixing the financial problems  which i understand the agency is proceeding under the new secretary of homeland security  does not in any way give reason to deny extra funds for an organization that is entrusted with the security of this nation .,Democratic
we can find common ground on security and immigration .,Democratic
this happens to be one  to provide the resources for this agency in order for it to avoid closing its doors .,Democratic
his description of the problems ice is having financially confirm the concern that i have had for some time .,Democratic
we do not have enough officers .,Democratic
we do not have enough training  and certainly we do not have enough staff in order to do their job .,Democratic
training programs have been postponed .,Democratic
they have halted training for approximately 2000 former detention enforcement officers who are reclassified and combined with the immigration agent position called immigration enforcement agent .,Democratic
do you realize  mr.,Democratic
chairman  that these officers are still carrying the old ids and old id cards and old badges ?,Democratic
why ?,Democratic
because we do not have enough money to give them new badges and new cards .,Democratic
can we not include them in this emergency supplemental ?,Democratic
this is an emergency .,Democratic
you have officers who are carrying incorrect identification and officers who have not been trained who have been transferred into homeland security who are now supposed to be immigration  customs enforcement officers .,Democratic
tragically  one of our officers lost his life in the atlanta courthouse killings  a man who had served for a good number of years .,Democratic
we owe officers who are willing to put their life on the line  no matter what way they have lost it  to be able to provide them with the resources necessary .,Democratic
ice has approximately 900 agents who have not yet been trained .,Democratic
without this training  ice can not use these officers for any type of law enforcement function except transportation officer and possibly some computer work .,Democratic
and as i said to you  they have no badges  and they have no id cards .,Democratic
there is no money for uniforms  so un-uniformed immigration enforcement agents are not able to order replacement uniforms .,Democratic
in fact  the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration naturalization service patches on them despite the fact that the ins no longer exists .,Democratic
lack of funds appears to be causing detention facilities problems in san diego  california and other places .,Democratic
let me just simply say we have the documentation  mr.,Democratic
chairman .,Democratic
i rise to ask my colleagues to support this amendment to ice  and i also will add that i support the palestinian money and the sudan money .,Democratic
but i hope that we will know that we have to secure the homeland by providing extra dollars to respond to the needs of our own staff here in the department of homeland security .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration  border security  and claims  i have learned of a budget crisis in the homeland security department 's bureau of immigration and customs enforcement  ice .,Democratic
at a hearing last week on interior immigration enforcement resources  immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice 's financial difficulties .,Democratic
his description of the problems ice is having financially confirms the concern i have had for some time now .,Democratic
for instance  training programs have been postponed .,Democratic
this has halted training for approximately 2  000 former detention enforcement officers who were reclassified and combined with immigration agent into a position called  `` immigration enforcement agent  '' iea .,Democratic
ice has approximately 900 agents who have not been trained yet .,Democratic
without this training  ice can not use these officers for any type of law enforcement function  except transportation officer and possibly some computer work .,Democratic
there is no money for uniforms  so uniformed immigration enforcement agents are not able to order replacement uniforms .,Democratic
in fact  the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration and naturalization service  ins  patches on them despite the fact that ins no longer exists .,Democratic
lack of funds appears to be causing a detention facility in san diego  ca  to release detainees from custody .,Democratic
apparently  ice management told its employees that the office had to reduce its adult detentions from several hundred to around 100 .,Democratic
additional funding is needed nationwide to maintain the approximately 17  000 detention beds currently in use .,Democratic
ice 's financial problems have resulted in a hiring freeze since last march and severe spending restrictions .,Democratic
in september  ice ordered its offices to refrain from nonessential spending such as travel  temporary duty assignments  equipment and supply purchases  and permanent change-of-station moves .,Democratic
ice is a bureau in financial crisis .,Democratic
they do not have enough money to hold people in custody  buy new uniforms and equipment for employees  or even issue badges and credentials with the correct department on them .,Democratic
emergency funds are essential to correct this problem .,Democratic
former dhs deputy secretary james loy said recently that ice needs $ 280 million to finish out the year .,Democratic
it is not feasible to address that entire need with the emergency supplemental  h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
my amendment  therefore  just seeks $ 40 million  which can be offset in the coast guard allotment .,Democratic
for the reasons stated above  mr.,Democratic
chairman  i ask that my colleagues accept the jackson-lee amendment to fund the immigration and customs enforcement needs .,Democratic
it is a shame that this amendment could not get a waiver of the point of order for the crisis in our department of homeland security .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for bringing forth this amendment  with myself and the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs.,Democratic
myrick ) xz4002880 .,Democratic
with all due respect to the previous speaker  this is not about debating the merits of the necessity or the needs for a new embassy in baghdad .,Democratic
having traveled to baghdad twice  certainly there is a strong case that can be made that we do need to be moving forth on a new embassy  but this is how we are going to pay for that new embassy  getting back to regular order and procedure around here  and how we are going to afford the cost of this new embassy rather than just going into deficit spending .,Democratic
this amendment speaks to a larger issue .,Democratic
the last time i was in iraq  which was last fall  i noticed one thing  we are dropping a lot of concrete in iraq today  which is an indication that we are going to be there for a very  very long time .,Democratic
and year after year coming forward with more multibillion supplemental spending requests  all deficit financing  is not a sustainable policy .,Democratic
we need to get back to regular procedure and regular order around here  and what better place than to start on a nonemergency creation  the siting of a new embassy to get it to the appropriate committee for proper oversight and hearings of deliberation  and then finding the appropriate offsets to pay for this .,Democratic
i am going to support the supplemental today  as i have past supplementals .,Democratic
i believe our troops need to get all of the tools and resources to do their job safely and effectively .,Democratic
they have been doing a terrific job under very dangerous circumstances  including our state department personnel  who are working in the current embassy within the green zone in baghdad which is also at times a free-fire zone .,Democratic
but at some point we as a chamber and as a body need to get back to the regular process of starting to anticipate these costs  starting to appropriate it and budget for it so we do not leave a huge legacy of debt for future congresses and for our children and grandchildren to inherit .,Democratic
that is what this amendment speaks to .,Democratic
i want to especially commend a couple of units serving us so well from western wisconsin  the 128th infantry guard as well as the 1158th transportation unit .,Democratic
in fact  earlier this morning i got up and ran over to walter reed hospital to visit with some of our troops  including specialist andrew carter from the 128th who almost had his foot blown off due to an rpg that was fired at him during one of his passing patrols .,Democratic
just last week we lost another member from western wisconsin who was shot down in the line of duty  staff sergeant andrew bossert .,Democratic
he will be buried in wisconsin this thursday .,Democratic
i am sure members will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family  his parents  but especially to his wife olya who lives in wisconsin .,Democratic
what we need to start considering at some point is whether or not the ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan should be paid for as part of the normal budgeting process .,Democratic
these are no longer surprises and no longer emergencies .,Democratic
we know we are there .,Democratic
we know what the mission is going to entail and the costs we are facing .,Democratic
i think this is a good place to start by having this embassy go through the regular process where we can find offsets and an ability to pay for it .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
berman ) xz4000250 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the gentlewoman 's amendment .,Democratic
it is long overdue that action be taken on this criminal and mass murderer  and i hope all of my colleagues will vote for this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as the daughter of a veteran  25 years in the army  i want to express my profound respect and appreciation for our brave men and women serving on the ground in iraq .,Democratic
they have a very difficult job  and all of us pray for their safe return  and many of us want them home very quickly .,Democratic
the administration 's request for an additional $ 82 billion brings the total war funding to nearly $ 300 billion .,Democratic
we must continue to ask just where has this money gone ?,Democratic
for example  the coalition provisional authority was unable to account for about $ 9 billion  and that is just what we know .,Democratic
where did that money go ?,Democratic
we deserve to know .,Democratic
the american people deserve to know what our tax dollars have paid for .,Democratic
did that $ 9 billion go  for example  to protect our troops ?,Democratic
we have no idea .,Democratic
another important question is  are we safer today than when this war began ?,Democratic
the answer is plainly no .,Democratic
if one believed the administration  the goal of the war was to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists and that iraq posed an immediate threat to the united states .,Democratic
now it appears that this unnecessary war may have actually increased that threat .,Democratic
instead of stopping terrorism  this administration 's policies have allowed it to expand .,Democratic
according to the national intelligence council  this administration 's war has turned iraq into a breeding ground for islamic terrorists .,Democratic
before the war on iraq  there was no connection  no connection  between saddam hussein and al qaeda .,Democratic
now there is .,Democratic
congress requires the administration to give a thorough accounting of how our tax dollars have been spent pursuing these policies in iraq and what the administration 's expectations are for future expenses .,Democratic
and despite this law  the administration has flatly refused to make this accounting to us  to the american people  or to determine what the future costs will be .,Democratic
we know  however  what has been overlooked .,Democratic
there is a documented failure to provide our troops with both body armor and armored vehicles .,Democratic
there are documented cases of waste and fraud perpetrated by contractors like halliburton .,Democratic
mr. chairman  it is the height of hypocrisy for members of congress to say that they support our troops and then fail to insist on the accountability of how these funds are being spent and whether or not the previous resources allocated were spent to protect our troops .,Democratic
if one asks me  the bush administration just wants another blank check .,Democratic
no oversight  no accountability  and they have failed to provide a concrete plan for how our troops will stabilize the situation in iraq and to bring our troops home .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this administration has much to account for .,Democratic
there have been too many blank checks and not enough accountability .,Democratic
i will vote against the supplemental and urge my colleagues to do the same .,Democratic
mr. chairman  yesterday  the u.s. commission on international religious freedom  a federally mandated bipartisan commission  released a comprehensive report documenting the mistreatment of asylees in america .,Democratic
for those seeking asylum  we strip-search them and then we thrown them in jail with criminals .,Democratic
as we debate this bill  thousands of people seeking safety from persecution are in jail with criminals in the united states .,Democratic
they are here fleeing from torture  from rape ; some are here seeking freedom because they have been denied the opportunity to practice their religion  say christianity  in a place where religion is not permitted .,Democratic
but when they get here  we lock them up .,Democratic
and today we are considering a bill that will make it harder for those fleeing oppression  trying to find safe haven in our nation .,Democratic
this bill does nothing to make us safer .,Democratic
in fact  we have heard references to those who came prior to the first world trade center bombing .,Democratic
we made changes in the law subsequent to that .,Democratic
that fix has already been done .,Democratic
we do not need to do what is before us today .,Democratic
so it is surprising we are not addressing today the shocking findings of the commission report .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to say something else .,Democratic
this bill  despite the protestations  is in fact creating a de facto national id card .,Democratic
it establishes one type of id that most americans will carry .,Democratic
all our information will be held in databases linked together and readymade for use by the federal government .,Democratic
how much will they really know about each and every one of you ?,Democratic
this is not just about immigrants  this is about all americans ; and i think we need a national conversation about whether we want that form of big brother .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
i would like to thank the committee leadership for their efforts to provide our men and women in uniform with the equipment that they need to succeed .,Democratic
as a member of the house armed services committee  i have worked with my colleagues to provide much-needed force protection equipment to our troops .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
1268 includes $ 75 million for body armor  $ 51 million for up-armored humvees  and $ 611 million for add-on armor kits for vehicles .,Democratic
having visited our wounded soldiers at walter reed army medical center  i know that we can prevent further injuries by funding this important equipment  and i appreciate the committee 's efforts in this area .,Democratic
furthermore  the bill raises the military death gratuity from $ 12  000 to $ 100  000 and increases subsidized life insurance benefits from $ 250  000 to $ 400  000 for families of service members who died or were killed on active duty  retroactive to october 7  2001 .,Democratic
as a cosponsor of legislation to increase the military death gratuity  i believe we must appropriately honor those that have made the ultimate sacrifice  and these benefit increases are one small gesture that congress can make to demonstrate our respect .,Democratic
this legislation also demonstrates our nation 's commitment to aiding those in dire need throughout the world .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
1268 includes $ 656 million for disaster relief to the victims of the tsunami as well as essential peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance to darfur .,Democratic
however  i was deeply disappointed that the house leadership used a procedural move to attach the language of the real id act  which i opposed when the house considered it in february .,Democratic
the real id act would significantly alter our nation 's asylum and immigration laws in the name of homeland security  though its provisions went far beyond the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
the senate has already registered some opposition to the real id provisions  and i fear that their inclusion in the house 's supplemental bill will slow down the process and prevent us from sending assistance to those who need it most .,Democratic
our primary responsibility should be to assist our men and women in uniform and to fulfill our promises to the nations that were devastated in the december tsunami .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to move swiftly to pass this measure and to drop any extraneous provisions that would hinder this important funding .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am pleased to have worked with the gentleman from arizona ( chairman kolbe ) to develop recommendations on the international assistance portion of the bill .,Democratic
as the gentleman from arizona ( chairman kolbe ) said  the bill does cut $ 1.2 billion in nonemergency initiatives from the administration 's international assistance request as well as rescinds an additional $ 1 billion in previously appropriated funds that are no longer needed  and i certainly concur with most of the chairman 's recommended cuts .,Democratic
however  i do want to express my concern that we will be expected to fund some of these items on the fiscal year 2006 bill  and as i anticipate a 302 ( b ) allocation for the foreign operations bill that may cut the 2006 request  these needs will be tough to accommodate .,Democratic
we are now into year three of the reconstruction programs in afghanistan ; yet the administration continues to rely on off-budget emergency supplementals to fund ongoing reconstruction .,Democratic
there are clearly many nonemergency items in the $ 2 billion requested for afghanistan in this bill .,Democratic
the establishment of a stable democracy in afghanistan with their own security forces is the key to bringing our troops home .,Democratic
the administration  i am concerned  has set back that effort by overuse of the emergency supplemental mechanism instead of providing appropriate assistance within the normal appropriations process  and i do hope in working closely with the gentleman from arizona ( chairman kolbe )  we will be able to provide sufficient funds that are so important for the future of afghanistan .,Democratic
i am very pleased that the committee was able to protect funds for continued urgent needs in afghanistan  especially for initiatives that support women and girls .,Democratic
the supplemental contains approximately $ 63 million in support of education  health  economic  democracy programs that target women and girls .,Democratic
and i am pleased with the generous amounts in the bill for the tsunami relief and reconstruction  as well as other items that advance our foreign policy interests .,Democratic
i will be supporting the jackson amendment to add $ 100 million for unmet needs in africa because in my judgment the ongoing complex crisis in the democratic republic of the congo  liberia  northern uganda  ethiopia  and somalia may be out of the media spotlight  but the human suffering continues and additional funds are urgently needed to provide food and medical assistance to refugees  to facilitate refugee returns  and to provide drought-related aid .,Democratic
the congress does have a responsibility to real disasters and to ensure that the united states is generous in our response to crises throughout the world .,Democratic
we have been extraordinarily generous with our tsunami relief  and i think we need to follow suit to meet the real needs in africa .,Democratic
i would also note that the bill contains $ 200 million for the west bank/gaza program with appropriate safeguards for monitoring and auditing .,Democratic
fifty million of the $ 200 million will improve the flow of goods and people with israel and will thus improve the security of israel and the region .,Democratic
finally  i will be also supporting the maloney amendment to transfer $ 3 million from esf accounts to unfpa to assist tsunami victims .,Democratic
the unfpa  with its proven track record and longstanding presence in the tsunami-affected areas  is uniquely placed to immediately respond to the needs of women and children  populations among the most vulnerable after disasters such as the tsunami .,Democratic
in closing  i just want to say for me i want to applaud the important efforts of the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) ; the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000  ranking member ; the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860 ; and the gentleman from arizona ( chairman kolbe ) .,Democratic
we wrote the bill together .,Democratic
i think it is a good bill  it is an important bill  and provides very vital services to important places around the world where there are ongoing emergencies .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
i want to thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Democratic
kolbe ) xz4002260 for addressing this important amendment that my friend  the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Democratic
jackson ) xz4001980  introduced .,Democratic
i feel strongly about the urgency of this issue and i look forward to working with the gentleman in the committee as we approach conference to ensure that this emergency that the gentleman has addressed in his amendment is certainly placed in the conference and we can provide the needed assistance .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman so much for his willingness to work with us to make sure that this happens .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. speaker  when h.r.,Democratic
1268 was first considered on the floor in march  i reluctantly supported its passage .,Democratic
now that the conference report has been returned to the house for this chamber 's approval  i still find myself torn because i do not see how additional funding for the iraq war effort will ultimately produce a positive outcome for the united states or for the people in iraq .,Democratic
i want a successful exit strategy -- not a permanent occupation in iraq .,Democratic
despite my misgivings for the direction of our iraq policy  or lack thereof  i do not believe our troops  who are fighting so bravely  should be penalized for the mistakes in judgment of our civilian military leadership at the white house and the pentagon .,Democratic
as we speak  our ground forces scrounge for scrap metal to make the unarmored vehicles more safe against insurgent attack .,Democratic
the funds provided in this bill will enable our soldiers and marines on the ground to uparmor their vehicles .,Democratic
there should be more outrage from the american public that they were deployed without adequate equipment from the beginning .,Democratic
but they are there .,Democratic
it is vital that our troops receive the equipment they need to defend themselves against attack .,Democratic
i have been critical of our war planning from the outset .,Democratic
i voted against the authority that allowed the president to take action in iraq .,Democratic
i continue to be frustrated that our war plan still contains no game plan on when we can begin to bring our troops home .,Democratic
i am pleased that the bill does contain provisions that require the administration to develop a set of performance indicators and measures for determining the stability and security in iraq and report its findings to congress .,Democratic
this requirement falls well short of the exit strategy we need to determine how long our commitment in iraq will last .,Democratic
the bill also funds tsunami relief  which is well overdue .,Democratic
the agreement appropriates $ 656 million in direct assistance to tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by last december 's tragedy .,Democratic
the total includes $ 5 million to support environmental recovery activities ; $ 10 million to create new economic opportunities for women ; and $ 12.5 million to support initiatives that focus on the immediate and long-term needs of children .,Democratic
the bill provides $ 400 million for humanitarian assistance in the darfur region of sudan and elsewhere in africa  including funds for the temporary resettlement of refugees .,Democratic
it also funds $ 240 million for international humanitarian food assistance through the food for peace program  much of which will go to the darfur region .,Democratic
this assistance will provide some relief to those who are being victimized by the ethnic cleansing that is being waged against the black muslim population by the arab muslim-dominated sudanese government .,Democratic
in a period when the president and this congress proposes reductions in programs that support the development of local communities and neighborhoods  the bill provides $ 592 million for a gold-plated embassy compound in iraq .,Democratic
i find it very difficult to defend such spending when the budget priorities of this administration propose disinvesting in our cities  towns and our american workforce .,Democratic
money for this project goes beyond providing office and working space for u.s. foreign service personnel .,Democratic
what we are proposing to build is not an embassy  but a compound  with stores and other amenities which will further distance our american embassy personnel from the iraqi civilian and political population .,Democratic
we are constructing a fortress  not an embassy .,Democratic
i want a successful exit strategy -- not a permanent occupation in iraq .,Democratic
another key element of this agreement with which i take issue is the mandate imposed on states that requires certain identification standards on driver 's licenses for federal identification purposes .,Democratic
the measure mandates that states meet certain requirements for determining the validity of persons applying for drivers ' licenses .,Democratic
although the bill provides authority for states to receive federal grants to comply  it is insufficient and amounts to an unfunded federal mandate .,Democratic
the money contained in this bill will go a long way to saving lives  saving the lives of our land forces in iraq and afghanistan and reconstructing the lives of those who experienced the devastation of last year 's tsunami .,Democratic
after weighing the alternatives  i reluctantly support the passage of this bill .,Democratic
i am not happy with the choices we are making today .,Democratic
i feel backed into a corner without much wiggle room  but the lives of our troops matter to me and they deserve the protection this bill is designed to deliver to them .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense  the global war on terror  and tsunami relief  2005 .,Democratic
i have had the opportunity to visit iraq twice over the last 2 years and visit with our military women and men and survey the operations of the u.s. reconstruction mission in iraq .,Democratic
never have i been more proud to be an american than when i visited our troops and observed them in the line of duty .,Democratic
my trips reconfirmed that we must give our troops the tools and resources they need to carry out their mission safely and effectively so they can return home soon .,Democratic
for this reason i am supporting the administration 's supplemental request for $ 81 billion .,Democratic
specifically  i would like to highlight the good work of the 128th infantry division out of western wisconsin  and the 1158th transportation company out of tomah  black river falls  and beliot .,Democratic
the 128th is on their first tour of duty in iraq and is performing well  despite several equipment shortages and setbacks the unit has dealt with .,Democratic
the 1158th is on their second tour of duty  and is also performing above and beyond their mission .,Democratic
i am extraordinarily proud of their service to our country .,Democratic
i am especially proud of young men like andrew carter .,Democratic
today i had the opportunity to visit andrew  a member of the 128th  at walter reed hospital .,Democratic
he was recently injured in iraq riding in a humvee that was hit by an rpg .,Democratic
there is a good chance he would have been killed if it had n't been for vehicle armor that was added to the humvee .,Democratic
this supplemental appropriates more funding to continue to armor humvees  so that we can continue to save lives .,Democratic
one of the first things andrew said to me was that he wants to heal quickly so he can get back to iraq and serve with his unit .,Democratic
his resolve is a good reminder of the dedication of our men and women in uniform and why we need to renew our commitment to soldiers like andrew .,Democratic
while i do not endorse all of the supplemental 's provisions  in the absence of a funding alternative  i support the need to provide for our troops .,Democratic
but we do need to start budgeting and paying for their obligations  such as the need for a new embassy in iraq  instead of passing so-called `` emergency '' supplementals and leaving a legacy of debt for our children to inherit .,Democratic
as our military effort continues  i and other members of congress will work to ensure that our service men and women have all the resources necessary to fulfill their mission .,Democratic
again  my thoughts and prayers are with those serving our country  as well as their families .,Democratic
america is firmly behind our troops and we 're all hoping to see them home safe  secure  and soon .,Democratic
may god continue to bless these united states of america .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the chairman for accepting this amendment  and i rise in support of the maloney amendment .,Democratic
with experience and success in saving lives and helping to ensure the safe delivery of tens of thousands of babies in more than 50 countries and territories  unfpa is uniquely qualified to assist victims of the tsunami devastation .,Democratic
a small transfer of $ 3 million to the unfpa would go a long way in making an immediate and tangible impact on the lives of women and children in indonesia  sri lanka  and the maldives .,Democratic
i again thank the chairman for accepting this language  and i thank my colleague  the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Democratic
maloney ) xz4002510  for placing the language .,Democratic
the unfpa currently has a flash appeal for $ 28 million  of which they have received almost 70 percent .,Democratic
our contribution would represent approximately 11 percent  bringing them much closer to meeting five pressing needs in the region .,Democratic
first  unfpa is providing safe delivery kits  hygiene kits  medicines and supplies  including soap and sanitary napkins .,Democratic
these basic items help stem the transmission of hiv/aids and ensure safe childbirth and emergency obstetric care .,Democratic
in communities ravaged by natural disaster  the lack of such important and simple supplies as these can result in serious life threatening health crises .,Democratic
second  unfpa works to reestablish maternal health care clinics and services destroyed by the tsunami such as prenatal care and delivery assistance and post-natal care .,Democratic
as we know  disasters put pregnant women at much greater risk for miscarriage or premature labor .,Democratic
approximately 150  000 women in the tsunami affected region are pregnant .,Democratic
fifty thousand women alone will give birth in the next 3 months .,Democratic
third  unfpa would work to prevent and treat cases of violence against women .,Democratic
it is a sad fact that women are more likely to be victims of sexual assault and violence in times of crisis .,Democratic
we have already heard disturbing cases of widespread sexual violence in sri lanka .,Democratic
unfpa programs help to provide emergency response  security and legal services to better protect women and children .,Democratic
unfpa programs would also offer psychological counseling to women and children still suffering from the horror of the tsunami .,Democratic
in countless cases  mothers are dealing with the nearly unfathomable pain of losing their husbands and children or  conversely  children are trying to make sense of a world without their families .,Democratic
many women are now faced with being the head of their household and their mental well-being will be paramount as they gather the strength to rebuild their communities .,Democratic
and finally  unfpa will help unaccompanied women and other vulnerable people access vital services such as water  food  health care and sanitation facilities .,Democratic
unfpa is especially well placed to do this life-saving work as it already has offices in all the tsunami-affected countries and long-standing relationships with local governments and non-governmental organizations .,Democratic
we all know that confusion and discord often stymies our efforts to get relief and support to those who need it most .,Democratic
supporting organizations with a proven track record and programs in place is one of the most successful and cost-effective ways to make our generous contributions go farther .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to do everything we can to help the women and children who have already been through so much with the destruction brought by the tsunami .,Democratic
please join me in voting to support unfpa 's important work in saving lives .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my amendment moves $ 3 million from the economic support fund  which has over $ 1 billion available  to the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund  which now has over $ 600 million available .,Democratic
it is not subject to a point of order and is both budget authority and outlay neutral .,Democratic
the reason for this amendment is very simple .,Democratic
it is to help pregnant women impacted by the tsunami .,Democratic
the intent of my amendment is to give $ 3 million to the u.n .,Democratic
population fund to assess tsunami victims in indonesia  sri lanka  and the maldives for very specific  pressing needs that i am very sure we can all agree are absolutely necessary at this time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the conference report .,Democratic
and i would like to take a few minutes to express my support with some provisions included in the foreign operations chapter of this supplemental bill .,Democratic
first and foremost  i am pleased that we have finally appropriated funding to address the earthquake and tsunami that devastated asia .,Democratic
the images of destruction  parents separated from their children  whole villages flattened and emptied  livelihoods washed away  touched the american people deeply and brought out the most generous and humanitarian impulses in us all .,Democratic
i am disappointed  however  that it has taken congress so long to respond officially on behalf of the united states  but i am happy that we finally have a robust package of aid to offer affected nations .,Democratic
i want to thank chairman kolbe  senators mcconnell and leahy for responding to my request to ensure that the needs of women and children around the world are addressed in this supplemental .,Democratic
of the $ 656 million included in the bill for tsunami-related assistance  over 200 million will be dedicated to directly meet the needs of women and children  and much of the remainder of those funds will be of indirect benefit through the restoration of infrastructure needed  such as new schools and roads .,Democratic
the bill also makes a strong statement about u.s. support for a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .,Democratic
it provides 200 million to help the palestinian people improve their economic situation .,Democratic
i also want to thank chairman kolbe and my colleagues in the senate for agreeing to provide most of the $ 100 million added by the house for emergency needs in africa outside of sudan .,Democratic
unfortunately  the horrible tragedy in sudan has meant the diversion of funds needed to address ongoing problems in the democratic republic of the congo  liberia  ethiopia  and uganda .,Democratic
this 100 million  along with additional funds for public law 480 food aid  will go a long way toward easing the pain and hunger expressed by many women and children throughout africa .,Democratic
while i have deep concerns about other provisions included in other sections of this supplemental  i am pleased with the shape of the foreign operations section .,Democratic
i believe it goes a long way toward fulfilling our many commitments around the world .,Democratic
mr. chairman  $ 3 million .,Democratic
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time once again  i presume the gentleman is talking about merged at some later date .,Democratic
obviously  the must-pass bill would not be available next week .,Democratic
am i correct ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for accepting the amendment  and i would like to note that because of the tsunami most of the midwives lost their lives .,Democratic
fully 30 percent of them died in the tsunami  and many of those who survived are still dealing with personal trauma .,Democratic
so it is incredibly important that this funding be moved to unfpa  the u.n .,Democratic
population fund  to help the tsunami victims and particularly those who need maternal health care services .,Democratic
many of my colleagues  including the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Democratic
lowey ) xz4002460  who has worked so hard on helping women and children  she traveled to the region early this year and was able to witness firsthand the horror along with the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
crowley ) xz4000870 and the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
linda t. snchez ) and others  and they were able to see the work unfpa has been doing to help these people .,Democratic
i thank the leadership for accepting the amendment .,Democratic
it is an important one .,Democratic
we appreciate the consideration .,Democratic
my amendment moves $ 3 million from the economic support fund  which has $ 1.06 billion available to the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund  which now has $ 656 million available .,Democratic
it is not subject to a point of order and is both budget authority and outlay neutral .,Democratic
the reason for this amendment is very simple : it is to help pregnant women impacted by the tsunami .,Democratic
the intent of my amendment is to give $ 3 million to the u.n .,Democratic
population fund unfpa  to assist tsunami victims in indonesia  sri lanka  and the maldives for very specific  pressing needs that i am sure we can all agree are absolutely necessary at this time .,Democratic
more than 150  000 women are currently pregnant in the tsunami-affected areas  including 50  000 anticipated to give birth during the next three months .,Democratic
unfpa is determined to enhance the likelihood of deliveries occurring in safe and clean conditions by providing emergency care  basic supplies and helping to rebuild health care facilities .,Democratic
they are uniquely qualified to provide these services .,Democratic
in fact  they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day  helping save the lives of women and children .,Democratic
with these funds  unfpa can provide safe delivery kits : soap  plastic sheeting  razor blades  string and gloves ; personal hygiene kits : sanitary napkins  soap  laundry detergent  dental supplies ; reestablish maternal health services ; prevent and treat cases of violence against women and youth offer psychological support and counseling ; and promote access of unaccompanied women to vital services .,Democratic
each of these areas is a serious problem and will go a long way toward helping save the lives of thousands of women and their children .,Democratic
disasters put pregnant women at greater than normal risk because of the sudden loss of medical support  compounded in many cases by trauma  malnutrition  disease or exposure to violence .,Democratic
in times of high stress  pregnant women are more prone to miscarriage or to premature labor  both of which require medical care .,Democratic
the infrastructure for helping pregnant women in the tsunami region is severely damaged .,Democratic
1  650 of the indonesian midwife association 's 5  500 members -- fully 30 percent -- died in the tsunami .,Democratic
many of those who survived are still dealing with personal trauma and the loss of equipment used to safely deliver babies .,Democratic
about 15 percent of pregnancies under normal conditions require urgent assistance from midwives or doctors to ensure the health and survival of the babies and mothers .,Democratic
many maternity hospitals  women 's health clinics  and other infrastructure for providing health services to women  maternal health assistance  safe delivery  contraceptives  emergency obstetric care  and preventing sexually transmitted diseases have been destroyed by the tsunami .,Democratic
mr. chairman  to date  the united states has provided no funding to the u.n .,Democratic
population fund to help tsunami victims .,Democratic
the last time the united states contributed resources to unfpa was $ 600  000 for similar kinds of emergency assistance in afghanistan in 2001 .,Democratic
we have several colleagues who traveled to the region earlier this year and witnessed the horror of the tragedy .,Democratic
they were able to see the work unfpa has been doing to help these women .,Democratic
i hope that they will be able to relay their experiences today .,Democratic
it is time to put politics aside .,Democratic
these people have suffered enough .,Democratic
we must do everything we can to help them .,Democratic
mr. speaker  when the house debated this legislation in march  it voted 420-2 to approve an amendment  which i authored  which reaffirms the u.s. commitment under the convention against torture to not engage in torture  and to not render or transfer people to countries where they are likely to face torture .,Democratic
the u.s. signed this treaty under president reagan  and the senate ratified it in 1994 .,Democratic
despite our commitments under this treaty and the recent statements made by the bush administration emphasizing that the u.s. is emphatically and unambiguously against the use of torture  there have been repeated reports in the press indicating that the u.s. has been sending detainees to countries where they are likely to face torture  including to countries who have become notorious for their human rights violations .,Democratic
the practice of extraordinary rendition is shrouded in secrecy .,Democratic
an unmarked plane arrives in the middle of the night carrying men wearing plain clothes and black hoods  to take custody of the prisoners  cut off their clothes  drug them on the spot  shackle them  and fly off into the night .,Democratic
president bush signed a secret directive reported to speed up the process by eliminating the case by case evaluation .,Democratic
and while unofficial estimates put the number of renditions since 9/11 to be between 100 and 150  the actual number of renditions remains a secret .,Democratic
the administration maintains that it is in full compliance with the convention against torture .,Democratic
compliance  they say  is guaranteed by the dubious practice of asking countries known to torture prisoners for `` promises '' that they will not torture our prisoners .,Democratic
these so-called `` diplomatic assurances '' then provide the cover for sending a suspect to that country to undergo interrogation .,Democratic
the list of countries where the detainees have been rendered includes syria  uzbekistan  saudi arabia and egypt .,Democratic
so here is the sand on which the administration stands -- at the same time that we exhort the international community to isolate syria for thumbing its nose at u.n .,Democratic
resolutions to get out of lebanon  the united states has apparently been willing to accept syrian promises that it will comply with the convention against torture .,Democratic
here is what the state department 's annual human rights report says about syria 's methods of interrogation : `` administering electrical shocks  pulling out fingernails  forcing objects into the rectum  ... .. '' and the list goes on .,Democratic
how about uzbekistan ?,Democratic
-- '' suffocation  electric shock  rape  beatings  and boiling prisoners to death .,Democratic
.,Democratic
.,Democratic
'' and the list goes on .,Democratic
the so-called `` diplomatic assurances '' that we have received from the torturers that they will not torture those we send them are not credible  and the administration knows it .,Democratic
cia director porter goss basically acknowledged as much when he stated : `` but of course once they 're out of our control  there 's only so much we can do.,Democratic
'' attorney general alberto gonzales confirmed this  when he said `` once someone is rendered  we ca n't fully control what that country might do.,Democratic
'' section 1031 of the conference report would prohibit the use of any funds included in this supplemental appropriations bill to subject any person in custody or under the control of the united states to torture or cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the constitution  laws  or treaties of the united states .,Democratic
while the conferees approved senate language that is slightly different from that of the house-passed amendment  i am nevertheless supportive of this language .,Democratic
i support it because i read section 1031 to clearly prohibit any appropriated funds from being spent to subject any person in u.s. custody or control to torture or other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by transferring  extraditing  or rendering such persons to countries where they are likely to face torture .,Democratic
this is because such actions clearly would be prohibited under article 3 of the convention against torture  a treaty signed and ratified by the united states .,Democratic
article 3 of the convention clearly states that : `` no state party shall expel  return ( `` refouler '' ) or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.,Democratic
'' article 3 of the convention further states that : `` for the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds  the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations  including  where applicable  the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross  flagrant  or mass violations of human rights.,Democratic
'' it would be my expectation that the funding limitation contained in section 1031 would therefore prohibit funds from being used to transfer persons to any nation where the person was likely to face torture  and that under section 1031  funds could not be used for transfers or renditions in situations where the u.s. government had found there to be a consistent pattern of gross  flagrant  or mass violations of human rights .,Democratic
i would also note that in a september 2004 report to the united nations general assembly  the un special rapporteur on torture expressed concern that reliance on diplomatic assurances is a `` practice that is increasingly undermining the principle of non-refoulement '' and observed that where torture is systematic  `` the principal of non-refoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to.,Democratic
'' we take pride that even as our nation fought for its survival against the nazis and the japanese empire during world war ii  that we did not ask our `` greatest generation '' to engage in torture or other war crimes .,Democratic
the legacy of the u.s. then  and now as we prosecute the war on terror  is that we uphold our commitment to justice -- even in the face of shadows of terror and war .,Democratic
the test of a nation is found as much in how it wages war as in how it promotes the values of peace and democracy .,Democratic
that is what we must do today .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from arizona .,Democratic
mr. chairman  more than a 150  000 women are currently pregnant in the tsunami-affected areas  including 50  000 anticipated to give birth during the next 3 months .,Democratic
unfpa is determined to enhance the likelihood of deliveries occurring in safe and clean conditions by providing emergency care  basic supplies  and helping to rebuild health care facilities .,Democratic
they are uniquely qualified to provide these services .,Democratic
in fact  they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day  helping save the lives of women  children  and families .,Democratic
with these funds  unfpa can provide safe delivery kits  such as the one i have here .,Democratic
it includes basic supplies such as soap  plastic sheeting  razor blades  string and gloves  laundry detergent  dental supplies .,Democratic
these are supplies that are needed to prevent and treat cases of violence against women and youth .,Democratic
they also offer psychological support and counseling and promote access of unaccompanied women to vital services .,Democratic
each of these areas is a serious problem and will go a long way towards helping save the lives of thousands of women and their children .,Democratic
disasters put pregnant women at greater-than-normal risk because of the sudden loss of medical support .,Democratic
mr. speaker  passage of this legislation demonstrates our commitment to our brave men and women in uniform and acknowledges that they need resources in order to accomplish their mission and return home safely .,Democratic
it also offers support for the families when a loved one pays the ultimate sacrifice in the cause of fighting for freedom .,Democratic
all along  i 've been concerned about the lack of progress reports coming from the pentagon .,Democratic
this bill finally requires the pentagon to use real performance indicators to report to congress with our progress in terms of security  economic  and iraqi security force training goals .,Democratic
the money that will go directly to help our troops is of course the most important part of this bill .,Democratic
it increases the military death gratuity to $ 100  000 and increases life insurance benefits to $ 400  000 for families of soldiers killed while on active duty in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
we 've all been hearing reports about the lack of adequate personal and vehicle armor .,Democratic
congress has funded these critical protections in the past and we 're doing so once again in this bill .,Democratic
i hope that this money will quickly be turned around to provide the needed add-on vehicle armor kits  new trucks  more night-vision equipment  and essential radio jammers to defeat the roadside bombs that are injuring and killing our troops almost every day .,Democratic
our troops should not be compromised .,Democratic
resolving the current instability in the region is in the long-term best interests of all americans -- failure in iraq would lead to irreparable consequences .,Democratic
thousands of american troops have been in iraq for more than 2 years .,Democratic
we have to take care of them and ensure that they can come back home as soon as possible .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time  and i rise in opposition to the so-called real id act of 2005 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  while i have enormous respect for the gentleman from virginia  the chairman of the full committee  i must take exception to the assertions that have been made by a lot of speakers here today that somehow this bill will prevent or would have prevented the 9/11 attacks from occurring .,Democratic
i just want to point out that regardless of the number of licenses that the terrorists held on september 11  they were all obtained because those individuals were in the country legally on student visas .,Democratic
and student visa holders in the future  even after this act is passed  will still have the opportunity to get licenses .,Democratic
so that argument is indeed bogus .,Democratic
but i want to talk about the most egregious parts of this bill .,Democratic
under this bill  it would allow the secretary of the department of homeland security to nullify all of our laws while fulfilling his responsibilities under the scope of this act .,Democratic
and putting aside the schizophrenic immigration policy we have heard from the republican party  you have a president that wants to have open borders and basically amnesty to allow open borders for low-wage workers to come in  and then you have a republican house that is saying that all those coming in must not have licenses .,Democratic
they must be pedestrians .,Democratic
mr. chairman  under this act  what this means for american citizens is  our civil rights laws will be set aside under this bill .,Democratic
our nondiscrimination laws will be set aside under this bill .,Democratic
our health and safety laws will be set aside under this bill .,Democratic
our environmental laws will not apply under this bill .,Democratic
and child labor laws will not apply under this bill .,Democratic
most troubling of all  the public bidding laws of this country will not apply under this bill for this project .,Democratic
right now on the committee that i serve with the esteemed chairman  we are investing no-bid contracts that were given to halliburton .,Democratic
we have millions of dollars in overcharges to the united states taxpayer  we have bribery charges  and we are doing all kinds of investigation on that no-bid .,Democratic
there is no reason that the civil rights laws and the public bidding laws should be set aside .,Democratic
if that were not the most extreme example  they have removed any opportunity for judicial review under this act .,Democratic
there will be no review of the secretary 's action in setting aside all of those laws  no recourse .,Democratic
it is ironic  mr.,Democratic
chairman  that while we have our soldiers in uniform protecting democracy  we are giving it away under this bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding me the time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise to express my deep frustration with the process being used by the republican leadership in this house .,Democratic
the bill before us today radically changes  among other things  the asylum law of this country .,Democratic
religious groups  civil rights groups  human rights groups have all expressed grave concerns with this legislation .,Democratic
there are serious and legitimate concerns with this bill  but the chairman of the committee on the judiciary did not hold a single hearing or markup in the 109th congress .,Democratic
in fact  the bill bypassed the committee on the judiciary completely .,Democratic
despite the chairman 's rhetoric  there are provisions included in this bill that were never considered in the last congress .,Democratic
the pattern of abuse by the republican leadership continues unchecked .,Democratic
major bills are being rushed to the floor without even a passing glance by the committee of jurisdiction .,Democratic
bills are being brought up without members getting the chance to read them .,Democratic
thoughtful amendments are routinely denied an opportunity even to be debated .,Democratic
the rule that we are considering right now provides for only general debate .,Democratic
later today  the committee on rules will meet again on h.r.,Democratic
418 to decide whether the amendment process will be open or closed .,Democratic
yesterday  among several other amendments  our colleagues  the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 and the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
meek ) xz4002700  testified that they believed the asylum provisions in this bill will make it harder for a persecuted person to gain asylum in the united states .,Democratic
they have an amendment to strike that language from the bill  and i hope the house will have an opportunity to consider that amendment .,Democratic
those who gain asylum are legitimately fleeing from persecution in their home countries .,Democratic
they are fleeing for their lives ; but under this bill  a woman forced by her government to have an abortion who tries to flee from such oppression will be forced to return to her home country .,Democratic
i can not believe that the united states government would be that cruel and we would turn our backs on people who need asylum in order to truly be free from torture and persecution .,Democratic
let me be clear .,Democratic
every one of us wants to make this country safer and more secure and prevent any further attacks  but this bill is not going to do it .,Democratic
asylum already is a highly scrutinized process and is very difficult to get .,Democratic
by law  terrorists are already barred from gaining asylum .,Democratic
what we need is better enforcement of the laws we already have  not a bill that restricts the flow of the persecuted just because a few in this body either do not like immigrants or feel the need to pander to political pressures from immigrant haters in their districts .,Democratic
as i said  there are other amendments that were offered last night in the committee on rules by both democrats and republicans  a total of 14 .,Democratic
they are all important .,Democratic
they are all relevant to this bill .,Democratic
they all should be considered .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this is an important issue .,Democratic
for many  it is a life or death issue .,Democratic
the least we can do is give this bill an open rule .,Democratic
this is the very least we can do given the lousy process that we have been shown .,Democratic
what we should do  however  is send this bill back to committee  allow the committee to hold hearings and discuss this thoughtfully .,Democratic
let us hear from the experts .,Democratic
let us all understand the impact of this bill .,Democratic
let the committee do a markup and send the bill to the full house for a vote .,Democratic
we can do better  and i would appeal to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to urge their leadership to stop trashing the rules  procedures  and traditions of this house .,Democratic
no matter what our views are on this bill  no matter what a person 's political party or ideology is  all of us i hope can agree that the current process undercuts democracy and diminishes this great house of representatives .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to oppose h.r.,Democratic
418  the real id act .,Democratic
this bill is an expansion of the patriot act intended to punish immigrants without making america any safer .,Democratic
any time a bill is brought to the floor with no hearings  no committee markup  and few opportunities for amendments  it indicates that its sponsors are trying to protect it from scrutiny .,Democratic
that 's certainly the case here .,Democratic
indeed a close look at this bill shows that its true purpose is not to make america safer  but to advance an agenda of ending america 's tradition of welcoming and protecting the rights of immigrants .,Democratic
this bill is about much more than driver 's licenses .,Democratic
it upends the process of granting asylum to individuals and families who have suffered torture or persecution in other countries .,Democratic
it expands the patriot act to allow more deportations for people with no connection to terrorism .,Democratic
no one doubts the need to review standards for issuing driver 's licenses .,Democratic
that is why congress worked on a bipartisan basis to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
the recently enacted 9/11 bill established minimum federal standards to ensure the integrity of drivers ' licenses issuance and verification .,Democratic
the regulations are in the process of being developed  with the input of the state agencies that issue driver 's licenses .,Democratic
enacting a new bill that prescribes eligibility for driver 's licenses would delay and disrupt the implementation of the 9/11 bill 's standards even before they have been put in place .,Democratic
the strongest reason to approach this issue thoughtfully is that the process of applying for driver 's licenses brings new people into government databases  which can be cross-referenced with fbi and terrorist watch lists .,Democratic
the only reason we had any information about the 9/11 hijackers  their whereabouts  and their connections to others  is because we could track information from driver 's license databases .,Democratic
shutting off this flow of information is not a smart or effective way to combat terrorism .,Democratic
this bill is only the latest example of how this congress has ignored regular order to rush a partisan bill to the floor with little deliberation or debate .,Democratic
i oppose this process and this bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as one of the conferees on the intelligence reform law enacted last december  i want to remind members that it contained 43 sections and 100 pages of immigration-related provisions .,Democratic
these tough  but smart new measures enacted just 2 months ago include  among others  adding thousands of additional border patrol agents  immigration and customs investigators and detention beds  criminalizing the smuggling of immigrants and establishing tough minimum standards for driver 's licenses  just as the 9/11 commission recommended .,Democratic
now we need to implement and fully fund these tough measures to ensure our nation 's safety .,Democratic
unfortunately  the president 's budget chose not to fund the 2  000 new border patrol agents or 8  000 additional detention beds that were called for in the intelligence reform bill .,Democratic
so much for being tough .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 would further undermine these tough measures by repealing several of these provisions .,Democratic
the bill would repeal a gao study to ascertain any vulnerability in the current asylum system and replace it with new burdens that would be impossible for many true asylum seekers to meet .,Democratic
proponents of this legislation have misled us by suggesting that different terrorists have received asylum .,Democratic
no terrorist has ever been granted asylum in the united states .,Democratic
we further ensured that terrorists would not be granted asylum with the administrative changes of 1995 and the expedited removal system done legislatively in 1996 .,Democratic
now we detain anyone seeking asylum that arrives at our border without documents .,Democratic
but asylum encourages citizens of other countries to fight for positive change in their own country  without risking u.s. military lives .,Democratic
if their life is endangered  they should have a chance to seek asylum in the united states .,Democratic
unfortunately  the legislation before us would make that nearly impossible .,Democratic
finally  if a person is a terrorist  i do not want to deport them so they have another chance at doing harm to the united states .,Democratic
i want to detain them  prosecute them  imprison them to the fullest extent of the law .,Democratic
the bill would repeal the tough minimum standards for driver 's licenses called for by the 9/11 commission and included in the intelligence reform law with provisions that federalize all driver 's licenses  take away states ' rights  place huge unfunded mandates on the states  without advancing the paramount objective of making state-issued identity documents more secure and verifiable .,Democratic
that is why the national conference of state legislatures strongly opposes this legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if you truly want to implement tough yet smart measures to ensure our nation 's security  vote down this legislation  and let us fully fund and implement the tough and smart provisions that were included in the intelligence reform bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act .,Democratic
it is unconscionable that the administration comes to congress for another emergency supplemental when it has failed to account for previous emergency funding  and has failed to include the cost of the war in the fy '06 budget .,Democratic
how can this administration offer a budget that does not include funding for america 's military operations overseas when we have more than 150  000 soldiers in iraq and afghanistan for an indefinite period of time ?,Democratic
why does the administration continue to resort to supplemental funding to pay for this war instead of including the cost in the budget where it will sufficiently reflect the impact of operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom on our deficit ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i did not support the iraq supplemental request last year because i had serious concerns about no bid contracts in the bill .,Democratic
unfortunately i was right to be concerned ; just today it has been reported that pentagon auditors have found excess billing for postwar fuel imports to iraq by the halliburton company totaling more than $ 108 million .,Democratic
to add insult to injury congress has not received any of the nine auditing reports from the pentagon  but instead must resort to receiving this information through unofficial channels .,Democratic
despite repeated requests  the administration has kept nine audits confidential from both republican and democratic members of congress .,Democratic
accountability is a bipartisan issue .,Democratic
this $ 81 billion emergency supplemental funding request for the department of defense 's iraq and afghanistan operations comes on the heels of $ 25 billion of emergency spending already appropriated for this year .,Democratic
enacting this request would mean that this congress will have provided this administration with almost $ 300 billion for military and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .,Democratic
it is clear that this body is willing to live up to its end of the bargain and provide funding for our troops  but the administration is determined to continue to avoid serious questions and concerns about its spending .,Democratic
let me state outright that i opposed going to war in iraq  but that is not my reason for opposing this supplemental request .,Democratic
i oppose simply because we can not allow continued deception by the administration on every aspect of our engagement with iraq .,Democratic
we were deceived with exaggeration of hussein 's weapons capabilities  and now we are being deceived about the duration of the engagement and its exact cost -- on the american purse and the loss of our men and women in uniform .,Democratic
we have exacerbated the situation in the middle east and put our country in a more vulnerable position because of this war  and now we are asked to surrender the responsibilities of this body to hold the administration accountable for its actions .,Democratic
mr. chairman as a member of congress i must provide answers to my constituents about the money that congress spends .,Democratic
accountability is not a partisan issue  we must all demand answers .,Democratic
our constitution was carefully crafted so as to allow a balance of power in our government .,Democratic
congress is obligated to use appropriations and the oversight that accompanies it as a means of holding the executive branch accountable for its spending of american funds .,Democratic
any attempt to usurp that balance of power is a betrayal of the moral fiber of our government and must be taken as an attack on the integrity of this body .,Democratic
the department of defense by law must submit reports to congress with a detailed explanation of the spending and future costs of the iraq war .,Democratic
these reports were due october of last year and at the beginning of this year .,Democratic
despite this legal obligation clearly delineated in last year 's defense appropriations act  we have to date received no report accounting for the spending and detailing cost estimates of previous supplemental funding .,Democratic
our government should not fail to meet its legal responsibility without consequence .,Democratic
how can we justify more emergency appropriations without adequate assurance that what has already been appropriated has been shrewdly spent ?,Democratic
sadly  we have no report directly from dod but the inspector general reported that almost $ 9 billion in reconstruction funding has been mishandled and poorly accounted for .,Democratic
in fact  the inspector general suggests that thousands of `` ghost employees '' were on an unidentified ministry payroll .,Democratic
in addition  dod has stated in the past that 220  000 iraq security forces had been trained and equipped  that number was then scaled down to 136  000 .,Democratic
moreover  the pentagon has recently put into question if these troops are truly prepared for service .,Democratic
mr. chairman  opposition to this bill is not a vote against supporting our troops .,Democratic
this body has proven over and over again through appropriations that it supports our troops .,Democratic
congress has appropriated $ 20 billion for iraq reconstruction despite the administration 's claims that iraq reconstruction would cost between $ 1 and $ 2 billion and could be financed by iraqi oil revenues .,Democratic
with enactment of this bill congress will have appropriated $ 300 billion for the efforts in iraq without proper accounting of the spending of these funds .,Democratic
the administration claimed that we would be received as great liberators and that just a few short months after the invasion we could start withdrawing troops  but instead we have no exit strategy and over 1  500 troops have died and thousands seriously injured .,Democratic
i could go on and on about the disastrous miscalculations and misleading estimates .,Democratic
this bill is critically lacking in accountability .,Democratic
no more blank checks for this administration .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
yes .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the problem with this bill is that it is an immigration bill posing as an identification bill .,Democratic
instead of listening to what the states told us needed to be done to make driver 's licenses more secure  what we have done is to basically make state motor vehicle employees unwitting immigration agents .,Democratic
it does little to improve homeland security  and it is certain to prove overwhelming and ineffective .,Democratic
now  i support what the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) is trying to do to improve the integrity of driver 's licenses  but i find it curious that the leadership of the house has chosen to largely ignore the multiple references in the 9/11 commission report to the value of on-card biometric technology in improving the integrity of identification cards .,Democratic
the problem is that these digital images are not sufficient .,Democratic
matching the image with the face is more prone to error than the technology that would use biometric data .,Democratic
two fingerprints transformed into numeric algorithm  that works .,Democratic
what we have here does not work .,Democratic
i think we are going to find the states letting us know that .,Democratic
unfortunately  it will be too late .,Democratic
we will miss an opportunity .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to this bill .,Democratic
one of the solemn honors that i have had as a member of congress is to visit our soldiers who have been wounded in iraq .,Democratic
i have visited with them at walter reed army hospital here in washington and at the veterans hospital at palo alto  california .,Democratic
it is rewarding and shocking to meet our troops under these circumstances .,Democratic
theirs are the stories of courage under fire .,Democratic
their wounds are almost unimaginable to those of us who are not sharing their world of combat .,Democratic
the treatment that they receive from the moment they are attended to on the battlefield  taken to battlefield hospitals  transported to germany and stabilized and brought home to the united states for specialized care and rehabilitation is a tribute to our magnificent military and veterans medical system .,Democratic
each time that i have left these brave men and women  i have had to confront my role as a policy-maker and whether or not i have done all i can to serve and protect them in their mission .,Democratic
i voted not to go to war in iraq because i believed at the time of the vote  and i believe now  that the case had not been made ; that the intelligence we had did not support what the bush administration was telling the american people was the threat that we faced from iraq .,Democratic
tragically  since that time  it has become clear that there was not only no imminent threat to the united states from iraq  but there was no plan for what our troops would encounter after the war was supposedly won .,Democratic
the duty this government owed to its soldiers when they were sent into combat was not met : not in the justification  not in the preparation and not in the planning .,Democratic
our obligation to them was simply not met .,Democratic
all americans now understand that the reasons that the bush administration gave to go to war in iraq were not true .,Democratic
the evidence did not exist .,Democratic
in spite of the advice of many in our military  in our state department and among our allies  the administration remained determined to wage a war in iraq .,Democratic
in short  the administration failed to be truthful with the american people and with the congress .,Democratic
as a result  since the first day of that war  americans have been paying 90 percent of the costs and suffering 95 percent of the casualties beyond those of the iraqi people .,Democratic
today  we are being asked to vote for another $ 81 billion for the war in iraq .,Democratic
this is the third supplemental appropriations bill for iraq since the war started  totaling nearly $ 200 billion ; and without a change in course  the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates the war in iraq and afghanistan will cost an additional $ 458 billion over the next 10 years .,Democratic
astoundingly  this additional request has no change in strategy forthcoming from the president to address the absence of control and continued violence against our troops and the iraqi people .,Democratic
the president and his advisers cling to the idea that america is just one major battle away from victory  or that with just one more capture of a significant insurgent leader we will break the back of the opposition to our occupation and to the formation of a democratic government in iraq .,Democratic
those who continue to attack our troops and the iraq people have been described in many different ways as the war has dragged on .,Democratic
first  we were told the resistance was under the command and control of saddam hussein .,Democratic
then they were described as disaffected baathists  and later they were just a bunch of `` bitter enders.,Democratic
'' we were told that a heavy battle attack of fallujah would break the back of the resistance .,Democratic
what happened instead was that we made 300  000 people homeless by flattening their city with little or no impact on the resistance .,Democratic
in fact  the violence rapidly spread to other major cities .,Democratic
while it has become clearer to those with both diplomatic and military experience that we must now develop a new strategy for success  it is resisted by the very same top command in the white house and the pentagon who have made so many errors and so many miscalculations that have continued to place so many of our military in circumstances in which they are not able to prevail .,Democratic
the opposition to change comes from the very same people that failed to carry out the due diligence to properly plan and prepare for the war and its aftermath .,Democratic
their failure to anticipate  plan  and train for the mission that our soldiers were faced with was a failure of the first duty of care owed by the commander in chief and the defense secretary to our troops  the duty to provide for the protection of our forces .,Democratic
this was not done  and the results have been thousands of wounded and killed  at the same time that the pentagon resists change and fails to transform its approach to fighting terrorism in iraq and elsewhere .,Democratic
so  today  nearly 3 years after 9/11  we still have no comprehensive policy to support the war on terror declared by the president .,Democratic
as a result  both our nation and our troops continue to face an unacceptable level of threat and danger .,Democratic
today  as we consider this request for supplemental appropriations  the dishonesty by the bush administration continues .,Democratic
this request itself is dishonest .,Democratic
it is labeled as an emergency  as if somehow the administration did not know what money it was going to need for the war in this year 's budget or in next year 's budget .,Democratic
yet we know the war has been costing between 5 and $ 7 billion a month and is likely to continue to do so under the current policy .,Democratic
the administration will not take responsibility for the cost of the war or how to pay for it .,Democratic
at the end of the day  the president and his advisers simply do not have the courage of their convictions .,Democratic
if they did  they would be honest with the american people about the real cost of war and the lack of progress being made on the ground  about the plan for drawing down our troops and about the real reason american soldiers were sent to iraq in the first place .,Democratic
i can not in good conscience vote to approve a supplemental appropriations bill that offers no strategy for success  that has no plan to draw down our troops in a responsible manner  and that fails to makes a compelling case to the american people about why the haunting sacrifices of lives  limbs and money have been necessary .,Democratic
i know that some of my colleagues  in very good conscience and with honorable intentions  believe that supporting this bill is the equivalent of supporting our troops .,Democratic
i would very respectfully have to disagree with that view today .,Democratic
rather  in my view  to vote for this supplemental is to expose our troops to the same leadership in the white house and the pentagon that refuses to tell the truth  that refuses to take responsibility for its actions  and that refuses to hold a single person accountable for the failed decisions that have been made for this war .,Democratic
and it exposes them to the same leadership that refuses to provide the kind of change that will start to remove the central organizing principal of the guerrilla war in iraq -- the presence of nearly 150  000 american troops viewed as occupiers by those who oppose us .,Democratic
to say that we must remain in the current configuration in iraq because the situation will get worse is to ignore the facts on the ground  facts that have been acknowledged by many of our field commanders  by members of congress who have visited iraq  and by members of the news media covering the war .,Democratic
this is a very difficult vote  i understand that .,Democratic
but let us be clear that this is not a vote about whether i or any other member of congress supports american troops .,Democratic
of course we do .,Democratic
and this is not a vote about the heroism shown by the thousands of iraqis who risked their own lives by voting in the national elections in january .,Democratic
they have my admiration and support .,Democratic
we support the troops by arguing against the kind of failed preparation and planning that sent national guard and reserve troops into battle without flak jackets and reinforced hum-vees .,Democratic
we support our troops by arguing in favor of a strategy for success .,Democratic
we support our troops by arguing against the president 's budget that dishonors our veterans by undermining the system of care and benefits they need and deserve .,Democratic
but we do not honor our troops simply by approving yet another allegedly emergency bill that offers no promise of success in an area of the world where success is not just critical  it is literally a matter of life and death .,Democratic
we can provide for the needs of our troops in a bill that also provides for success in this war .,Democratic
tragically  that bill is not before us today .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer an amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  it is very hard for me to respond to what the chairman just shared with us because basically if we do not pass this amendment of striking this 101 section  we might as well just take all the language in 101 and say  if you are being persecuted or if you are being raped as a woman or you are being abused as a child  do not come to america because that is basically what this amendment is saying .,Democratic
they were raising the bar beyond the capabilities of the individuals that are fleeing persecution .,Democratic
they are running for their lives literally  and many of these individuals are incarcerated .,Democratic
and where are the commercials ?,Democratic
where are the media reports of how lax our asylum laws are here in the united states ?,Democratic
because they are not .,Democratic
where are the law enforcement agencies ?,Democratic
why are they not knocking down the doors in the halls of congress saying  we really have to tighten up those asylum laws because they are too weak now ?,Democratic
where are they ?,Democratic
we are following the people who have focused on this the most  the 9/11 commission  and what they are asking for is for us to review and make sure we have good asylum laws in place .,Democratic
we are not saying it is bad .,Democratic
we are not saying it is good .,Democratic
i commend my colleagues who are looking at this  but moving in haste and having this manager 's amendment before the congress and no one has seen it .,Democratic
all of the agencies  all of the religious organizations that are helping these individuals that we are trying to deal with now are saying that they support the nadler/meek/jackson-lee amendment .,Democratic
i urge the members to please support the amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to thank you for your comments and also the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 for his leadership .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this amendment is based upon two facts that i think we agree on on both sides of the aisle .,Democratic
one was very articulately expressed by the chairman of the defense appropriations committee earlier today when he asserted the fact that we are a coequal branch of government .,Democratic
we are equally responsible for what military activity we engage in .,Democratic
we will be held equally accountable .,Democratic
and the fact that we hold the purse strings makes it incumbent upon us that we have some expectation of how much a war is going to cost  how we can budget for it  and particularly what measurable criteria are we seeking to enable us to complete our mission .,Democratic
the second fact is one that has been expressed time and again  particularly by our senior military officers  that we ought not engage in military activity  that we ought not go to war without a plan to win the peace .,Democratic
that is what this amendment addresses .,Democratic
it would give nominal resources to the secretary of defense to be able to give us the kind of information that we need to work with the executive branch to evaluate how we are doing in terms of succeeding in our mission in iraq .,Democratic
for example  what level of physical infrastructure reconstruction does the administration feel is necessary for the iraqi economy to be viable .,Democratic
we have invested billions of dollars in reconstruction .,Democratic
how much more might be necessary ?,Democratic
in terms of political stability  are we waiting for ratification of the constitution and then a subsequent election ?,Democratic
and if that election goes well  will that mean that we can gradually begin completing our mission at least in terms of the proportion of the troops that are currently committed ?,Democratic
and  particularly  what level of iraqi security forces will be necessary ?,Democratic
we have been given wildly varying numbers  40  000 to 160  000 to over 200  000 .,Democratic
what does it mean for iraqi security forces to be adequately trained and equipped ?,Democratic
does it mean a 6-week training course in human rights  which some have suggested meant that they could be considered security forces  or does it mean the kind of intensive training for many months that is comparable to what we give our troops so that they can engage in battle and can show leadership in the face of military confrontation ?,Democratic
those are things we need to discuss together .,Democratic
what we want are the measurable criteria .,Democratic
it is not an unreasonable expectation .,Democratic
and when we pass a supplemental that contains $ 600 million for a new embassy that maintains our substantial force in iraq  we want to make sure we do not give any credence to our enemies who  in secretary rumsfeld 's expression  seem to be able to recruit insurgents greater in number than we could ever possibly kill .,Democratic
they are able to do so by accusing us of being permanent occupiers  thereby denying iraqis of true sovereignty over their own country .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  it would remain in the bill that the administration would have to detail and share with us what is their strategy for success .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on february 17  2004  the national debt of the united states exceeded $ 7 trillion for the first time in our country 's history .,Democratic
one year later  our national debt is $ 7.7 trillion .,Democratic
in the past year  our country has added $ 700 billion to our national debt .,Democratic
the conference report for the fy06 budget resolution that is before us today would increase the statutory debt limit by $ 781 billion to a record $ 9 trillion .,Democratic
mr. speaker  enough is enough .,Democratic
the out-of-control rise in our national debt over the last year and the rise in our debt envisioned in this conference report are further signs of the terrible fiscal position in which we now find ourselves .,Democratic
in 2001  we had ten-year projected surpluses of $ 5.6 trillion [ 2002-2011 ] .,Democratic
now  over that same time period  we have likely ten-year deficits of $ 3.9 trillion .,Democratic
that 's a $ 9.5 trillion reversal in our ten-year fiscal outlook .,Democratic
whether intentional or otherwise  our country 's current fiscal policies are depriving the federal government of future revenue at a time when we ought to be preparing for an unprecedented demographic shift that will strain social security and medicare .,Democratic
our current fiscal irresponsibility will eventually land squarely on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren  who will be forced to pay back the debt we are accumulating today .,Democratic
the `` debt tax '' that we are imposing on our children and grandchildren can not be repealed .,Democratic
it can only be reduced if we take responsible steps now to improve our situation .,Democratic
both parties need to work together in a bipartisan fashion to bring our budget back into balance so we can avoid the higher long-term interest rates and weakened dollar that are the inevitable consequences of rising deficits and a high national debt .,Democratic
we are witnessing on a daily basis the reaction of the global financial markets to our fiscal irresponsibility  and as we can see in this conference report  congress has not yet gotten the message that deficits and debt matter .,Democratic
for starters  congress needs to reinstate paygo rules for the entire budget  including spending and revenue measures .,Democratic
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts of the budget will not have a significant impact on our rising deficits  as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony before the budget committee .,Democratic
this fiscal year alone  interest on the national debt is expected to rise to $ 178 billion  and the administration projects that that figure will increase to $ 211 billion during the next fiscal year .,Democratic
to put that figure in perspective  projected interest on our national debt next year will be $ 75 billion more than projected spending on education  public health  health research  and veterans ' benefits combined [ $ 138 billion ] .,Democratic
further  the budget conference report before us today  which was filed only three hours before the house began to consider it  would require the house to cut medicaid funding by as much as $ 15 billion over the next five years .,Democratic
just two days ago the house voted  by a vote of 348-72  to reject harmful cuts to the medicaid program  and this conference report blatantly ignores the will of the house .,Democratic
in addition to assuming an ever-larger share of our annual budgets  the interest on our debt  and the debt itself  are increasing our reliance on foreign borrowers  which will weaken our position in the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america .,Democratic
over the last year  our country has borrowed nearly $ 400 billion [ $ 389 billion ] from foreign countries  and almost half [ 44 % ] of our publicly-held debt is held by foreign creditors [ $ 1.96 trillion  out of $ 4.4 trillion of publicly held debt ] .,Democratic
finally  our deficits and debt threaten the social security and medicare programs that have raised so many of our seniors out of poverty and helped sustain the strongest middle class in history .,Democratic
with a projected 75 year unfunded liability of $ 3.7 trillion  both parties in congress need to work together to address social security 's solvency problem  and this conference report does nothing to protect social security .,Democratic
in fact  it continues the practice of raiding the social security trust funds to pay for other expenses of the federal government .,Democratic
it is time for congress to stop playing games with our national debt  with social security  and with our kids and grandkids ' futures and take a commonsense  bipartisan approach to solve our budget problems .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this is truly a bipartisan bill  the defense part of it in particular .,Democratic
chairman young and i have worked very closely together .,Democratic
he visited some places ; i visited three bases .,Democratic
we found shortages .,Democratic
we found problems .,Democratic
we tried to rectify those problems .,Democratic
we tried to put in what the people in the field asked us and what needed to be done .,Democratic
we realized that insurance payments needed to be changed .,Democratic
we realized that the death benefits needed to be changed .,Democratic
we also realized there is a jurisdictional problem  but we felt like it could not wait .,Democratic
i have had 12 people killed in my district  and there is no question in my mind for the need for that to be changed .,Democratic
but the thing that is the most important in my estimation is accountability .,Democratic
chairman young and i sat in his office not long ago and talked about the bill  and he got his copy of the constitution out and it talked about accountability .,Democratic
it talked about congressional accountability .,Democratic
and i thought how unaccountable the defense department seems to be at this stage .,Democratic
they do not seem to realize we are not here to hurt them  we are here to help them .,Democratic
we believe that if you do not have the confidence of the people  if you do not have confidence in the way the money is being spent  you are going to lose confidence in the overall project  the overall philosophy  the overall direction we are trying to go .,Democratic
we put language in the bill last year  and we said  you have got to give us a report .,Democratic
that report is 3 or 4 months late .,Democratic
no reason for that to happen .,Democratic
they had plenty of notice .,Democratic
and it should have been on our desk before this bill was up so that if there was something that needed to be rectified  we could rectify it .,Democratic
there are two reports .,Democratic
i do not know if the second one is late yet or not .,Democratic
of course that takes us to the next step and that is the thing with the intelligence which we have read in the newspaper and which i can neither confirm nor not confirm has happened .,Democratic
but i worry that things are getting out of control that we do not know about .,Democratic
we sit and try to help them every way we can .,Democratic
many of the things we put in this bill they did not ask for because they did not know about it .,Democratic
we found out about it  and we made sure that was part of the presentation  part of this bill .,Democratic
i have to say that when i meet with the secretary of defense  when we listen to his presentation  we always say to him  chairman of the full committee  chairman lewis  chairman of the defense subcommittee the last time  chairman young  we always say  look  we 're here to help you .,Democratic
give us these reports .,Democratic
tell us how you 're spending this money .,Democratic
when i saw there was a $ 9 billion fund that was not accounted for according to the auditors  and  of course  this is not appropriated money  this is money provided for the oil  but still we should know where it goes because it can replace some of the money that we are appropriating for these resources .,Democratic
i would just conclude by saying this is our responsibility under the constitution  and i am hopeful that the defense department gets the message .,Democratic
i support the bill and will do everything i can to get it passed .,Democratic
of course  any problems we have in conference i am sure we will work them out .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
edwards ) xz4001180 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of this conference committee report .,Democratic
but  mr.,Democratic
speaker  the american people whose sons and daughters are fighting this war and the senior military officers who are directing this war deserve to know what the white house will consider to be success in iraq .,Democratic
now  this conference committee report includes language that would require the administration to fully evaluate the situation in iraq and provide the congress with measurable  achievable criteria  including the following : an assessment of the number of troops it will take to secure the peace and how those troops would be rotated ; key measures of political stability  such as ratification of a national constitution and permanent national elections now scheduled for next year ; the estimated strength of the iraqi insurgency and the extent to which it is composed of noniraqi fighters ; the operational readiness of iraqi military forces  including the type  number  size  and organizational structure of iraqi battalions that are capable of conducting counterinsurgency operations independently ; the fact is that our long-term presence in iraq will only give our enemies in the region a greater ability to recruit terrorists and build public support for violence .,Democratic
that is the opposite of our objective there .,Democratic
i do think it is past time to lay out for the american people what is our strategy for success .,Democratic
this language that is included in the report will require the secretary to report no later than 60 days after the enactment of the supplemental and every 90 days thereafter .,Democratic
that is progress .,Democratic
we support our troops .,Democratic
we have to complete this mission  but we also need to work together .,Democratic
the fact is  the american people whose sons and daughters are fighting this war do not have the ability to require this of the administration  nor do the senior military officers .,Democratic
it is our responsibility  and i am glad that this congress is committed to performing that responsibility .,Democratic
on balance  it is a good bill  and i support it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words  and i rise to oppose the amendment .,Democratic
i have to say what i say about the administration  about the defense department many times .,Democratic
just because you say it  does not mean it is so .,Democratic
just because we say we are going to put $ 5 million in does not mean it is going to be a truman commission .,Democratic
we have bill language which says they have to report to us at a certain date  and they did not do it .,Democratic
so there is no doubt in my mind this is not something that is going to happen .,Democratic
i do not say we are wasting time because there is no question accountability is our responsibility .,Democratic
but we are not going to get any responsibility this way .,Democratic
as far as i am concerned  what we are saying  this language is not bill language .,Democratic
it does not mean that they are going to do it .,Democratic
and so i oppose the amendment .,Democratic
and i think we ought to get rid of this amendment and get on with the rest of the business on the floor .,Democratic
mr. speaker  it has been 2 years since president bush stood aboard the uss lincoln aircraft carrier and declared  `` mission accomplished '' in iraq .,Democratic
and in those two years it has become increasingly clear that the war in iraq is far from over  and that the american people are paying the price .,Democratic
let 's just take a look at the facts : there are currently 150  000 american troops now serving in iraq  including 8  000 reserve and national guard troops .,Democratic
tragically  1  582 american service members have been killed in the iraq war .,Democratic
at least 12  243 u.s. troops have been wounded in action  many with grievous injuries that will require a lifetime of medical assistance and other types of support .,Democratic
more than one in five iraqi war veterans have some type of mental disorder caused by their wartime service .,Democratic
in addition to the cost of life and quality of life for the brave american men and women who are fighting in iraq  the dollar cost of the war is also taking its toll on the american people .,Democratic
to date  $ 217 billion in american taxpayer dollars have gone to fund the war in iraq .,Democratic
we were told our allies would share the cost of the war ; we were told iraqi oil would pay for the cost of the war .,Democratic
now it is clear  there was no plan : the american taxpayer is paying for the cost of this war to the tune of $ 5 billion a month .,Democratic
in fact  today 's $ 82 billion supplemental is the fifth such supplemental congress has passed at the request of the bush administration to fund the war on terror .,Democratic
that 's billions of dollars not spent on pressing problems right here at home .,Democratic
problems  such as : the price of gas at the pump .,Democratic
gas prices remain at record levels at $ 2.24 per gallon nationwide  with some states topping $ 2.60 .,Democratic
that means gas prices have risen 33 cents in just the last two months and are 42 cents a gallon higher than a year ago .,Democratic
the energy department predicts that gas prices will climb to a record $ 2.35 by memorial day -- averaging $ 2.28 this summer .,Democratic
the high cost of health insurance .,Democratic
health care costs for families have skyrocketed almost 50 percent over the past five years .,Democratic
a lagging economy .,Democratic
the economy grew at just 3.1 percent in the first quarter -- the slowest pace in 2 years and down from a 3.8-percent pace logged in the final quarter of 2004 .,Democratic
declining wages and benefits .,Democratic
workers ' salaries and benefits have suffered the largest 3-year decline since 1948 ( as a portion of our economy ) even as corporate profits continue to rise .,Democratic
fewer jobs .,Democratic
446  000 private-sector jobs and 2.8 million manufacturing jobs have been lost .,Democratic
record budget deficits .,Democratic
this year 's deficit is on track to reach a record $ 427 billion .,Democratic
veteran 's benefits .,Democratic
over the next 5 years  the budget for veterans programs  primarily health care  is $ 14.2 billion below the amount needed to maintain services at current levels .,Democratic
and  record trade deficits .,Democratic
the u.s. trade deficit surged to an all-time high of $ 61.04 billion in february .,Democratic
two years after president bush declared mission accomplished in iraq  there is still no end in sight .,Democratic
instead of just signing another multi-billion dollar check to the administration  is n't it time to develop a real plan to stabilize iraq so we can bring american troops home and concentrate on our problems here at home ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i think the gentleman has good criteria for success  and the chairman and i have talked about this  and i think he has got a good idea here .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment .,Democratic
i would hope that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment .,Democratic
this is a very important amendment .,Democratic
i see what she is trying to do here .,Democratic
but the regular forces are just as short .,Democratic
as a matter of fact  this bill actually does not provide enough money for the regular forces .,Democratic
i understand the technicalities of it  that it should not be in a supplemental  it should be in a regular bill ; but to put all the o & amp ; m money in the national guard would do a disservice to the regular forces .,Democratic
i just visited three bases .,Democratic
all three bases were short in o & amp ; m money .,Democratic
they were short in almost every category .,Democratic
so i wish the gentlewoman would withdraw her amendment .,Democratic
we will take a look in the conference to see if the national guard needs more o & amp ; m money  and we will see what we can do .,Democratic
mr. chairman  we know the right questions to ask : about iraq  the budget  waste  fraud and abuse by contractors including halliburton .,Democratic
after seeing scenes from an iraqi prison  we know what we do n't know .,Democratic
what are we going to do about all this ?,Democratic
we know the right questions to ask  but we also know these questions will not be answered -- unless we reach back into recent history and reinstitute an independent  bi-partisan internal watchdog .,Democratic
in the 1940s  the truman committee saved the government and the american people $ 15 billion dollars .,Democratic
they asked the right questions and were empowered to get the answers .,Democratic
the american people got what they paid for and someone made sure of it .,Democratic
there was truth in government .,Democratic
there was trust in government .,Democratic
we do n't have that kind of faith  confidence  or oversight anymore .,Democratic
instead of scrutiny  there is subterfuge .,Democratic
already  america has spent $ 200 billion for the wars in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
yet two years after the start of the war  many troops and their transports still do not have adequate protection .,Democratic
this week  the administration will use the supplemental process to obtain new billions for iraq .,Democratic
the fact is  the supplemental process carries less scrutiny than the normal budget process .,Democratic
we know the right questions to ask  but getting the answers is a different story .,Democratic
billions of dollars have been awarded in non-competitive contracts .,Democratic
recently  the military acknowledged that 8 billion in cold  hard cash is missing in iraq .,Democratic
it 's happened before in iraq  and unless something changes  there is no reason to believe it wo n't happen again .,Democratic
halliburton has already been found to have overcharged the pentagon by billions of dollars for providing meals to soldiers and importing fuel .,Democratic
they 're still getting paid and no one really knows if we are getting what the american people are paying for .,Democratic
on a rare occasion  the defense secretary admits there is an issue ; quoting secretary rumsfeld : `` according to some estimates  we ( dod ) can not track $ 2.3 trillion in transactions.,Democratic
'' the pentagon 's own auditors admit that the military can not account for as much as 1/4 of what it spends .,Democratic
defense makes up half of all the discretionary spending in the budget .,Democratic
standard issue republican rhetoric decries waste  fraud and abuse .,Democratic
well  it 's time to turn the rhetoric into a plan of action .,Democratic
the truman committee eliminated corruption  profiteering and mismanagement .,Democratic
it uncovered defective systems  improved efficiencies in existing programs  and freed up billions of dollars for more crucial procurement .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from arizona .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer this amendment to strike section 101 of the bill relating to asylum seekers .,Democratic
under the excuse of protecting national security  the asylum provisions in this bill make it much more difficult for legitimate victims to be granted asylum .,Democratic
the logic seems to be  if you keep out every asylum seeker  including legitimate victims  then the system can not be abused .,Democratic
proponents of this section make inaccurate  dramatic claims about terrorists who abuse the asylum system to get into the country  but the cases they cite are mostly pre-1996 when the law was changed .,Democratic
since that 1996 change  asylum seekers are jailed  put in custody until a finding of reasonable fear of persecution is made  so they can not pose a threat while they are in custody .,Democratic
because current law already places the burden of proof on the asylum applicant and places the applicant in custody until he or she meets the initial burden of proof  a terrorist who wishes to enter the united states would most likely attempt to do so by a tourist visa or on fraudulent papers .,Democratic
they are not going to claim political asylum and then be put in jail until they can show a credible fear of persecution .,Democratic
but this bill seeks to raise the bar when people finally do get into court .,Democratic
if we pass this bill in its current form  mothers  fathers  children with legitimate asylum claims will be sent back to their persecutors with no benefit to national security .,Democratic
current law provides that an asylum seeker must prove a reasonable fear of persecution by reason of race  color  creed  national origin  sex  or political opposition .,Democratic
the new provision in this bill would require proof that one of these factors  race  color  creed  political opposition  is the `` central reason '' for the legitimate fear .,Democratic
this is an almost insurmountable burden of proof since the persecutors rarely stop to explain their motives while they are committing torture  rape  and murder .,Democratic
the judge would be forced to look into the minds of the persecutor and decide what weight to give to a particular motive in cases of mixed motives  which they are  in order to prove  the burden of proof  that this is the central reason .,Democratic
not one of the major reasons  a central reason .,Democratic
this is an impossible burden of proof with no purpose other than to deny the asylum claim .,Democratic
this section would deny a victim asylum based on an immaterial inconsistency or inaccuracy in a prior statement .,Democratic
so an applicant who  at the airport  perhaps without a decent understanding of english or a mistranslation  forgets or misspeaks the date of her high school graduation  or the date of her wedding or her grandchildren 's births  even though the dates might not be significant in her culture  unlike in ours  would later be denied safe haven from persecution  even though they have nothing to do with the legitimacy or lack of legitimacy of her claim for asylum under the law .,Democratic
this would be a ridiculously harsh outcome for an absurdly innocent mistake .,Democratic
there are other things that this section does .,Democratic
we did not have time to review it properly .,Democratic
it did not go before the committee .,Democratic
the provisions that were considered by the house last year was only a 2-page provision .,Democratic
this became a 10-page provision 2 days ago .,Democratic
no one has had a chance to properly look through it  but we do know that it does a lot of other very harsh things .,Democratic
mr. chairman  asylum law is supposed to be about protecting individuals from serious abuses of human rights .,Democratic
it is not supposed to be about seizing on any possible basis to deny a claim or to return people to harm 's way .,Democratic
this section is not about protecting our borders ; it is about xenophobia and sending victims back to their torturers .,Democratic
it is  mr.,Democratic
chairman  in the larger sense  un-american .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to stand with me in voting for the nadler-meek-jackson-lee amendment to strike these provisions and keep our law humane and american .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield for the purposes of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
conyers ) xz4000800 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
i heard my good friend from colorado ( mr.,Democratic
tancredo ) xz4003940 say that this amendment likely will not pass  but i hope maybe the debate will seek and help to convince him of the enormity of the crisis or at least the need in places like sri lanka  indonesia and many other countries that are impacted by the tsunami .,Democratic
if i might draw the gentleman 's memory to the video that showed a single train that had been the lifeline of sri lanka  an opportunity that i took in visiting sri lanka with a number of my colleagues  to see the enormous devastation in terms of the infrastructure of these countries  then the gentleman would realize that in addition to the charitable heart that americans have and the private contributions that have been made  and might i acknowledge the many donations given from the city of houston and the houston tsunami relief effort and the vietnamese relief effort and sri lankans and those from thailand and many  many others in the city of houston and the effort waged by president clinton and president bush  and in my community  jim mackinvale  and many others who worked hard to draw monies out of houston  and i know many other cities and states did the same .,Democratic
but the infrastructure dollars are so very important .,Democratic
so i would hope that my colleagues would oppose this amendment because you can not imagine  i believe  the depth of the amendment and the need to rebuild those countries  and those dollars will help to do so .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990  a cosponsor of the amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time remains ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
meek ) xz4002700 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the supporters of this legislation are completely correct that obviously real terrorist threats exist and we must act forcefully to safeguard our national security .,Democratic
but this bill is really three or four or five separate bills entirely  some of them unexceptional  some of them very questionable .,Democratic
under the excuse of national security  for example  the asylum provisions in this bill completely gut the possibility of many legitimate victims of persecution to be granted asylum .,Democratic
asylum law is supposed to be about protecting individuals  including women and children  from serious human rights abuses ; it is not supposed to be about seizing on any possible basis to deny a claim or return people to persecution .,Democratic
proponents of this bill have been making dramatic claims about terrorists abusing the asylum system to get into this country to perform acts of terrorism .,Democratic
but since 9/11  in fact  since the 1996 act  most asylum-seekers are in jail while resolution of their cases are pending so they can not pose a threat .,Democratic
what this bill does is to change the standards by which the judgment is made as to whether they should get asylum ; but while it is being judged  they are in jail .,Democratic
so this has nothing to do with alleviating a threat to this country .,Democratic
for example  one provision would change current law to require that the applicant prove that his or her race  religion  et cetera is a central reason instead of merely a major reason for the legitimate fear of persecution in order to get asylum .,Democratic
this would force asylum applicants to prove the state of mind of their persecutors .,Democratic
what is the central reason of several different reasons ?,Democratic
it makes it almost impossible to grant asylum .,Democratic
now  this was not  and some of the points in the manager 's amendment were not in the bill before us last year .,Democratic
no one has ever seen some of these provisions until yesterday .,Democratic
this provision  at least  and i am gratified that the committee on rules made the amendment to be in order by me and the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
meek ) xz4002700 and the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 to strike this section of the bill  and in order for it to be passed tomorrow so that the committee on the judiciary can properly vet this bill or the asylum provisions can be properly looked at and we can deal with it adequately .,Democratic
this section  in my judgment  would subject hundreds  maybe thousands  of people to being tortured or abused or shot because of their race  color  religion  creed  or opposition to a dictatorial regime back home  because it would make it impossible for them to get asylum .,Democratic
i think when this house examines this carefully  and when the committee examines this carefully  it will come to that conclusion .,Democratic
maybe we out to change the asylum provisions  but we ought to do it after careful consideration .,Democratic
so i hope that this bill will not be passed in its current form  and that my amendment will be passed so that we can give proper consideration to some of these provisions that do not really aid the national security  but do gut protection for people who need those protections .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. chairman  no person in our country should be given unfettered authority  unfettered discretion to waive any or all laws  for whatever the purpose .,Democratic
take this situation .,Democratic
in order to expedite construction of this fence  the department of homeland security could select a contractor without competitive bidding  use undocumented workers  violate child labor laws  pay the workers less than the minimum wage  exempt contractors from federal and state withholding ; workers could be forced to put in 18-hour-days without overtime pay  in unsafe conditions  and be transported in trucks used for hazardous cargo ; and allow the secretary discretion to have these workers construct fences and roads through private property .,Democratic
that is wrong .,Democratic
you can build a fence  but you do not have to violate all those laws .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860  the ranking member of the defense appropriations subcommittee .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Democratic
lowey ) xz4002460  the ranking member of the foreign operations  export financing and related programs subcommittee .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i grant myself the remainder of the time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the distinguished chairman talks about section 102 of the bill  which gives the secretary of homeland security the ability to waive all laws that might get in the way of building the fence ; and he talks about environmental laws  and he talks about endangered species .,Democratic
well  that is all well and good  but the radicalism and the irresponsibility of the majority is shown by how this is drafted .,Democratic
this does not refer to environmental laws .,Democratic
this does not refer to endangered species .,Democratic
this says the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive all laws in his sole discretion that he determines necessary .,Democratic
the secretary of homeland security can tell the contractors  if anybody gets in your way  shoot them .,Democratic
shoot them .,Democratic
the laws against men are waived .,Democratic
laws against anything are waived .,Democratic
it makes him a total dictator .,Democratic
then to make sure that the secretary can be a total dictator in contravention of the constitution  in contravention of all our laws  it then says  no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any clause or claim arising from any decision the secretary takes or to order any compensatory declarative injunctive  equitable or any other relief for damages alleged to have been suffered .,Democratic
so someone can be shot because the secretary says shoot anybody that gets in the way by accident or deliberately and the courts can not review whether the secretary had the authority  whether this is constitutional .,Democratic
last year we had certain court-stripping legislation before us to say that the court shall have no jurisdiction to hear a claim against the constitutionality of the defense of marriage act .,Democratic
one other thing  i got up on this floor and i said  this is going to become boiler plate language in bills  and here it is .,Democratic
it did not even mention it .,Democratic
boiler plate language .,Democratic
`` no court shall review any action the secretary may take.,Democratic
'' i thought the republican party stood for limited government .,Democratic
this says the secretary is absolute dictator  as absolute as stalin .,Democratic
what kind of language is this ?,Democratic
regardless of the merits of this bill  regardless of the merits of this provision in general  this is disgraceful .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how many speakers does the gentleman have remaining ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. chairman  if the previous speaker is going to describe something i did in committee  i wish he would get his facts straight .,Democratic
the fact is  contrary to what the gentleman said  when the majority brought its recommendations to the full committee with respect to the provision in the bill which raised life insurance benefits from $ 250  000 to $ 400  000  with respect to that provision  the committee had applied it retroactively only to those persons who died in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
contrary to what the gentleman said  my amendment did not restrict what the committee was doing  it expanded what the committee was doing .,Democratic
we added coverage for what was estimated to be 2  400 additional american service people who died but were not in iraq or afghanistan .,Democratic
we did that  for instance  on the theory that if you are a member of the reserve  you are called up to go to iraq  but you are killed in a training accident before you can get there  that you are just as dead  your family is just as much in need as would be the case with someone who went to iraq and then died in an accident .,Democratic
now  the gentleman is the chairman of the committee on veterans ' affairs .,Democratic
i respect his responsibilities .,Democratic
i hope he respects ours .,Democratic
i would simply say that what the committee has tried to do is to take a vehicle which is going to spend $ 80 billion of the taxpayers ' money  and use that as an opportunity to expand benefits to deserving servicemen and women .,Democratic
i make no apology whatsoever for doing that .,Democratic
dick bolling  who was my mentor when i came here and chaired the committee on rules  used to talk disdainfully of people who looked at this house through the prism of what he called `` dung hill politics '' ; in other words  focusing on jurisdiction of different committees  forgetting that we have a larger responsibility to the body as a whole and to the country as a whole .,Democratic
now  i make no apology for the fact that the committee on appropriations might have stepped on a few toes in expanding benefits for deserving servicemen and women .,Democratic
i am glad they did .,Democratic
i hope the toes did not hurt too much .,Democratic
but the fact is if the gentleman has objections to what the administration has suggested then i would suggest the majority party needs to get its act together rather than risking these expanded benefits by doing what they almost did in the committee on rules today  which is to make these two sections of the bill subject to a point of order which could have lost those benefits for deserving servicemen and women .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time remains ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to support the gentleman 's amendment .,Democratic
as the gentleman has made quite clear  this is his second choice .,Democratic
he would prefer to offer an amendment which directly establishes a truman-like committee to investigate profiteering in iraq .,Democratic
the fact is that the majority has chosen to use the technicalities of the rules to prevent that from happening .,Democratic
given the fact that they have done that  the gentleman 's only choice is to proceed in the manner he has proceeded in the amendment he has just offered .,Democratic
it seems to me that the purpose of the amendment is clear .,Democratic
the purpose is to see to it that a committee is formed which will have as its sole responsibility the reviewing of the use and misuse of taxpayer funds in iraq .,Democratic
this bill seems to me to be a perfectly appropriate vehicle to accomplish the end that the gentleman seeks .,Democratic
this bill appropriates over $ 80 billion of taxpayer money .,Democratic
i think the taxpayers  many of whom have substantial doubt  not just about the war but about the conduct of some of the contractors during and after the war  i think the taxpayers would like to know that if we are going into their pockets for an additional $ 80 billion today  at least we are doing the utmost possible to see to it that that $ 80 billion is spent in accordance with the law and is spent in accordance with good judgment .,Democratic
i  for the life of me  do not understand what the problem is with the gentleman 's efforts .,Democratic
it seems to me if this congress is looking for ways to achieve the maximum support for the administration 's policy  they would certainly support efforts to see to it that that policy is being conducted in such a manner that embarrassment is not eventually brought to the president  to this congress and to our effort in the country and in the region .,Democratic
so while this certainly is not our preferred solution  it is far better than doing nothing and i would urge support for the gentleman 's amendment .,Democratic
with all due respect  the gentleman just misquoted .,Democratic
reclaiming my time  with all the due respect  the gentleman misquoted and mischaracterized my amendment in committee .,Democratic
the gentleman described it as an amendment limiting benefits when in fact it expanded them  and i do not appreciate that .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from indiana .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Democratic
hoyer ) xz4001890  the minority whip .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am the last remaining speaker on my side .,Democratic
how much time do i have remaining ?,Democratic
reclaiming my time  with all due respect  the effect of my amendment as scored by cbo was to add $ 95 million in costs .,Democratic
what we did was to provide $ 95 million in additional benefits to persons who had died who were not living in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
that was the effect of my amendment .,Democratic
the gentleman may be talking about restrictions that the committee action took .,Democratic
my amendment expanded .,Democratic
it did not restrict  and the gentleman needs to reread it if he does not understand that .,Democratic
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  in regards to what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 just said  i am surprised at the new chairman .,Democratic
he is so lenient about getting time out of him .,Democratic
usually our bill moves much faster than this .,Democratic
i thought he learned .,Democratic
let me say the defense part of this and maybe the rest of it is probably the most bipartisan bill one could ever find .,Democratic
the gentleman from florida ( chairman young )  the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis )  and i have been traveling to these various bases .,Democratic
we found shortages every place we went  all kinds of problems that they brought to our attention that needed to be rectified .,Democratic
we found problems so severe that many of the units that were on their way to iraq were c-4 .,Democratic
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
cunningham ) xz4000910  my good friend  the hero from vietnam  knows what i am talking about when i say c-4 .,Democratic
i am talking about they are not ready to go to combat because the equipment is so bad .,Democratic
as a matter of fact  the equipment was so bad at one base  and i think it was fort stewart where the troops did not have radios to train with  did not have small arms ammunition  did not have mortar ammunition to train with  and that means that when they get there  they are not at the cutting edge of where they should be .,Democratic
now they get equipment when they get there  and that overcomes the c-4 .,Democratic
so the gentleman from florida ( chairman young ) and i  what we did was put $ 2.3 billion into the budget .,Democratic
we first checked  the staff checked  with the army to make sure that that is where it ought to be put .,Democratic
the army came back and supported us .,Democratic
usually  they beat around the bush .,Democratic
the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) knows what i mean .,Democratic
we talk to them  and because of other people over there  they do not want to admit that they need the money .,Democratic
this time they were very emphatic that they needed every cent and they needed it as soon as they could get it .,Democratic
so we added money for the types of things that they need .,Democratic
having said that  what i have said to the services because we are having such a problem  we see the recruiting problem  we are looking into that right now .,Democratic
the subcommittee i serve on  we realize and we have said for a long time  they are going to have a recruiting problem as this war gets unpopular ; and we were trying to figure out how do we overcome that .,Democratic
most times i disagree with those bonuses because i feel so strongly that people ought to join the armed forces for the good of the country  but we have to give bonuses to send them over there .,Democratic
we put money in for those kinds of things .,Democratic
we increased the amount of money somebody gets when they are killed in action .,Democratic
we expanded it so that when they are killed in action  they are taken care of retroactively as well as prospectively .,Democratic
we take care of somebody who is wounded .,Democratic
we added money to it .,Democratic
some veterans group called me and said they were not happy with the way we added that money .,Democratic
they felt like there ought to be more study  and i can not disagree with that .,Democratic
but when the four of us sat down  the gentleman from florida ( chairman young ) and senator inouye and senator stevens  we came to the conclusion that we just did not think we could wait .,Democratic
so we put money in to take care of people who were injured so severely as well as the ones that were killed .,Democratic
and i got so many letters from the people at home  and i have had 12 killed in my district  how pleased they were about what we are doing because it helped them get through a very difficult time .,Democratic
what we have tried to do over the years is make sure that the people that were in the armed forces had what they needed  that the people in iraq have what they need .,Democratic
our subcommittee brought to the attention of the country that they were without a lot of equipment in iraq .,Democratic
we are working right now .,Democratic
new trucks  we are trying to figure out how to put new trucks in that are encapsulated because we have taken care of the humvees  but we need to take care of the trucks now .,Democratic
so we got some commercial trucks which were recommended which were $ 100  000 less  but it was so late  we could not get it in the bill .,Democratic
we are going to ask for reprogramming for that amount of money .,Democratic
so this bill is taking care of equipment shortages  not all of them  but it is taking care of as many as we could possibly squeeze in .,Democratic
it is taking care of reset .,Democratic
we forced the military to ask for reset .,Democratic
the minute that this war is over and the money starts to dry up  reset will be the first thing they do not do ; so we have to do it now .,Democratic
and i have said to many of the industrial leaders in this country  the minute the war is over  there will not be any supplementals  there will be a lot less money to be spent  and we have got to spend this money now in the supplementals to make sure that that gets done .,Democratic
armor modularity  there is some argument about that ; but we think it ought to be done  and we have pushed this .,Democratic
many of the programs that the army has today have come about because of the defense subcommittee  chaired by the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391 and chaired by the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Democratic
young ) xz4004391 .,Democratic
many of the things that have happened have happened because we see it out in the field .,Democratic
we go out in the field  talk to the people  make sure that we are doing the right thing  and then we try to send defense in the right direction .,Democratic
so i urge the members to vote for this .,Democratic
the troops need it  and it helps dramatically for the amount of money that is needed by the armed forces .,Democratic
mr. chairman  could i ask the clerk to read the amendment ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
i made clear yesterday that based on conversations with andy card  the president 's staff director  i have agreed to withdraw this amendment pending the administration 's getting together with the leadership of the committee on appropriations and working out a process by which activities of the department of defense that are classified will in fact be communicated to the congress .,Democratic
i am not just talking about after the fact ; i am talking about a communication prior to the activities .,Democratic
i simply want to read one sentence from an article that appeared in the new yorker about this matter .,Democratic
it reads as follows : `` the intelligence system is now designed to put competing agencies in competition .,Democratic
what is missing will be the dynamic tension that ensures everyone 's priorities in the cia  the dod  the fbi and even the department of homeland security .,Democratic
the most insidious implication of the new system is that the secretary of defense no longer has to tell people what he is doing so they can ask  `why are you doing this ?,Democratic
what are your priorities ?,Democratic
' now he can keep all of the mattress mice out of it.,Democratic
'' well  if the congress considers itself to be mattress mice  then they will not be concerned about the reports that we hear about the department of defense 's activities .,Democratic
if the congress takes seriously its obligation to exercise the power of the purse  which is one of only two real powers that we have outside of actual legislating  and if the congress feels we have an obligation to this institution that transcends our obligation to the committees on which we serve  then the congress will see to it that the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do ; we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble in the first place .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want to make clear that i assume good faith on the part of the white house  and i hope we can work things out .,Democratic
but if we do not  i will be pursuing every possible avenue to see that an amendment such as this is adopted because this congress has an obligation to know what is happening in some of these covert and clandestine operations .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me simply congratulate the gentlewoman from oregon ( ms.,Democratic
hooley ) xz4001860 for her motion .,Democratic
i would hope that every member supports it .,Democratic
i think that the contents of it are important .,Democratic
in fact  we need to go further .,Democratic
we have increased in this bill insurance benefits for servicemen and women who die up to $ 400  000  but servicemen and women who come back from combat who are brain damaged  who have lost their sight  who have lost their arms  who have lost their legs  they come back to really very little assistance from uncle sam .,Democratic
in addition to what the gentlewoman is talking about  we also need to be looking at the huge hole that still exists in the earning power of those individuals  and we need to do a whole lot more than we are doing today .,Democratic
i think the hooley amendment is a great start  and i would urge every member of the house to vote for it .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) xz4002860  the ranking member of the defense subcommittee  the gentleman who has long been trying to extend debate in this chamber .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself 8 minutes .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this bill before us today makes clear that we have now spent $ 284 billion in iraq and afghanistan since the war began .,Democratic
the money that has been spent in afghanistan is certainly legitimate and justified .,Democratic
after all  that country harbored the people who attacked us on 9/11 .,Democratic
the problem is  however  that $ 165 billion has now been spent to deal with a country that did not attack us .,Democratic
we have spent some $ 240 billion on this entire endeavor since the president first landed in his jumpsuit on that carrier and addressed the country under the banner `` mission accomplished.,Democratic
'' there has been quite a bit of that mission left since it supposedly was over .,Democratic
we have now been involved in iraq longer than we were involved in world war i  and respectable and responsible experts have told me that they expect that we will be involved for at least another 5 years .,Democratic
this whole operation has been brought to us by the same people who erroneously told us that we had to go to war because iraq had weapons of mass destruction and it was implied that they had  or were close to having  nuclear capability .,Democratic
that was all demonstrated not to be true .,Democratic
this has been brought to us by the same people who believed the assertions that our troops would be welcomed with open arms .,Democratic
it has been brought to us by the same people who thought they were so smart that they knew more than general shinseki when the good general warned us that we would need substantially more troops and boots on the ground than we were scheduled to have if the postwar occupation was to go well .,Democratic
and it has been brought to us by the same people who provided to our troops insufficient armor for humvees  insufficient body armor and insufficient jammers to prevent our troops from having their faces and their legs and their arms blown off by remotely detonated bombs and mines .,Democratic
i want to make quite clear i will support this bill because i feel that i have no choice but to participate in cleaning up the mess which somebody else left .,Democratic
but i do not relish it .,Democratic
i believe that the entire operation in iraq has been accompanied by incredibly naive romanticism on the part of the white house and on the part of the civilian leadership in the pentagon  and that has left the people fighting the war to bear the brunt of the miscalculations that have been made by the civilian leadership of our government .,Democratic
we have lost the lives of 1  500 american service men and women .,Democratic
we have seen more than 11  000 be injured .,Democratic
and this bill understates  in my view  the amount of money that will be needed eventually to restore the readiness of the u.s. armed forces and to minimize their casualties .,Democratic
the second thing this bill does is to demonstrate once again how we  on both sides of the aisle  have had to work doubly hard to overcome the resistance of the white house in adequately funding homeland security operations .,Democratic
they have been especially resistant to providing the adequate funding along the borders  especially the canadian border .,Democratic
and it has taken a bipartisan effort on the part of a wide variety of people in this congress in order to overcome that resistance .,Democratic
this bill falls far short of the funding that is necessary to provide a secure set of borders for the united states .,Democratic
the new bill that is going to be offered by the gentleman from kentucky will help fill that gap  but that is forced to play catch-up because we have met a steady resistance effort on the part of the white house .,Democratic
lastly  i simply want to say that while i am certainly no expert on the subject  i note that there is being attached to this bill a provision which many experts in the field feel has the potential to construct a nationwide database that could be very harmful in terms of people 's efforts to engage in identity theft .,Democratic
i hope that proves not to be the case .,Democratic
i would simply make the point that certainly no one on our committee on either side of the aisle has the expertise that you would hope would be found in the authorization committees  and i wish that that provision had been dealt with on a separate bill rather than solving an internal problem within the republican caucus by having it attached to an unrelated bill  and i want to make one point about that .,Democratic
we are being lectured almost daily by the majority that we should not add ungermane riders to appropriation bills .,Democratic
i want to serve notice that if the majority feels free to add unrelated authorization bills such as this to a must-pass bill  that then i feel fully within my rights in offering whatever authorization legislation we feel appropriate on this side of the aisle and asking that it be attached to appropriation bills .,Democratic
if sauce is going to be okay for the goose  then it ought to be good for the gander .,Democratic
so we will see in the coming months what the attitude of the majority is when we seek to add what we feel are legitimate efforts to strengthen appropriation bills by adding various pieces of so-called legislation to appropriation bills .,Democratic
so since the majority has chosen to proceed down that path  i hope they raise no objection when we seek to follow it .,Democratic
with that  mr.,Democratic
speaker  again  i repeat i intend to vote for this bill with all of my misgivings .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Democratic
hoyer ) xz4001890  distinguished minority whip .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
moran ) xz4002831 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
crowley ) xz4000870 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
woolsey ) xz4004360 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  can i inquire how much time each side has remaining .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield for purposes of a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
george miller .,Democratic
),Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Democratic
lowey ) xz4002460 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself 3 minutes .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i take this time to explain the motion to recommit that i will offer at the end of this debate .,Democratic
here is what it does : the senate bill contains funding for a total of 150  000 border patrol agents  250 immigration investigators  and 168 immigration enforcement agents  and detention officers and their associated training and support cast .,Democratic
this conference agreement falls short of the senate bill in 3 areas .,Democratic
it only contains funds for 500 border patrol agents  not the 150  000 called for in the senate bill .,Democratic
it only contains funding for 50 immigration investigators  not the 250 called for in the senate bill .,Democratic
last  it also contains no funding for unmanned border aerial vehicles .,Democratic
the motion to recommit is simple .,Democratic
it would take us to the levels contained in the senate bill for border patrol agents by adding funding for 550 additional border patrol agents and for 200 immigration investigators .,Democratic
it would also fund unmanned border aerial vehicles that have been used successfully in a test in arizona to assist in surveillance .,Democratic
former dhs deputy secretary lloyd testified that the vehicles provided `` invaluable '' service .,Democratic
since border patrol agents are trained at the federal law enforcement training center in artesia  new mexico  funding is included like the senate bill to purchase and operate modular classrooms for these additional agents .,Democratic
this motion  in short  would provide an additional $ 284.4 million to immigration and customs enforcement to do this as was in the senate bill .,Democratic
need i remind anyone that the intelligence reform bill  which became law last december  called for 2  000 additional border patrol agents a year and 800 additional immigration investigators ?,Democratic
the president requested no funding for that supplemental request .,Democratic
i would note that on march 30 the administration announced it would add more than 500 agents in arizona  but those are not new agents .,Democratic
135 of them or so will come from other southwest and southern border patrol locations  and the remainder are simply new trainees who will replace agents retiring or leaving the border patrol across the country .,Democratic
so i would simply urge house members to vote for this motion .,Democratic
it ought not be at all controversial .,Democratic
it is practical if you want to put your money where your press releases have been with respect to border patrol .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
engel ) xz4001220 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
pelosi ) xz4003140  the distinguished minority leader .,Democratic
let me simply say that i find it ironic  mr.,Democratic
chairman  and i thank the gentleman for yielding  because the entire history of the development of this expanded benefit demonstrates that both the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) xz4002391 and this gentleman from wisconsin were aiming to expand benefits  not to contract them .,Democratic
when i first drafted my first proposal we were told that the committee on veterans ' affairs itself was concerned that we might have gone too far in providing benefits to people because  for instance  the example used to me was we do not want to pay someone who was killed in a drunken driving accident because he had five martinis at a bar .,Democratic
we want to make sure that this occurred in the line of duty .,Democratic
so that is the way we drafted the amendment .,Democratic
but the overall effect of the amendment was to add benefits for 2  400 people who had died  who had not been killed in iraq and afghanistan  and that was estimated to cost $ 95 million .,Democratic
how an expansion of benefits can be described as a restriction is beyond me .,Democratic
it certainly does not fit my definition .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present .,Democratic
if the gentleman will yield  does that mean we can not rise to strike the last word ?,Democratic
that is what we tried to do .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
reclaiming my time  let me simply say i appreciate that .,Democratic
my only point is if the gentleman is going to come to the floor and characterize what i did please do so accurately .,Democratic
what the gentleman said  he may not have meant to but what he said was my amendment limited -- i believe the word used was `` restricted.,Democratic
'' we did not .,Democratic
we expanded it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  let me thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Democratic
kolbe ) xz4002260  my good friend  for introducing this amendment  but i would like to touch on another area that is also very  very important .,Democratic
let me say that the border patrol need all the help that they can get .,Democratic
we have another serious problem that i hope that we can touch on  and that is what is known as the otms  or other than mexicans .,Democratic
my district includes a portion of the mcallen border patrol sector .,Democratic
last year  in the fiscal year  almost 17  000 otms came across through that border patrol sector  representing at least anywhere from 76 to 80 countries coming across into the united states .,Democratic
this worries me about the security of this country .,Democratic
as i talk to the border patrol officials  they know one thing  that we do not have sufficient detention facilities .,Democratic
so what happens to them ?,Democratic
they come across .,Democratic
they do not have to be picked up by the border patrol .,Democratic
they surrender themselves to the border patrol and say  i am from colombia  i am from egypt  i am from any other country ; and they know that they do not have sufficient facilities .,Democratic
so what happens ?,Democratic
they go and process these individuals  and they come in clusters from mexico .,Democratic
when they come across  it takes 10  12  15 border patrol people to come and bring them to the facilities to process them .,Democratic
it takes 2 1/2 hours to do that .,Democratic
when this happens  in the meantime  the border is completely open  because those border patrol people were removed to process these individuals .,Democratic
what happens next ?,Democratic
after the 2 1/2 hours  they go and take them to the bus station  and they give them a little piece of paper that says  you are supposed to appear on the 15th of whatever month  60 to 90 days from now .,Democratic
one of these guys just finished paying $ 900 to be brought across .,Democratic
do my colleagues think he is going to come in ?,Democratic
this is another issue that we need to study about .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the wartime supplemental that includes urgent funding for our soldiers and sailors now prosecuting the global war on terror in afghanistan and iraq .,Democratic
this bill also has important additional funding for border security  and language important to south texas shrimpers that will make it easier for them to hire workers for the coming season .,Democratic
as a member of the house armed services committee  i know our soldiers can do anything .,Democratic
yet that truth does not mean that the congress should skimp on our financial obligations to our fighting men and women .,Democratic
they run out of money altogether at the end of this month  so i am pleased we are finalizing this bill today .,Democratic
as a border congressman  i am grateful that the conferees included desperately needed funding for border security .,Democratic
i have been relentless in talking to so many of you about my concerns related to spending on border security matters .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin  mr.,Democratic
obey  for his work in getting negotiators to include this spending .,Democratic
while this is a good start  it still comes up short of both what we need and what the intelligence reform bill mandated we do .,Democratic
the intelligence reform bill passed by congress last year mandated 2  000 border patrol agents a year for the next 5 years .,Democratic
the president came to the table with only 210 in his budget ; today we are adding another 500 .,Democratic
that 's still over 1  000 short of what this government agrees is the very least we should do to protect our border and stem the tide of releasing otms -- illegal immigrants that are `` other than mexican '' -- into the u.s. general population .,Democratic
given our border security is entirely budget driven  this is a rare victory for those of us who have been talking about the need to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to protecting our nation from terrorists that may be trying to enter the country through the loopholes in our border security policy .,Democratic
we are sending our young soldiers to fight and die in iraq and afghanistan and we justify that by saying we are fighting the war there so we will not have to fight it here .,Democratic
we may very well be fighting a war over there and letting terrorists in our back door .,Democratic
as so many south texans and my colleagues know  i have been lifting my voice about how border security is profoundly lacking .,Democratic
currently  the united states does not have room to hold the large number of otms  caught by border law enforcement .,Democratic
while i know that most of these immigrants are merely seeking a better life  it is the few -- the handful -- that may be entering our country to do us harm .,Democratic
that is whom we need to worry about .,Democratic
so we are releasing  on their own recognizance  into the population of the united states very large numbers of otms.,Democratic
what happens is our border patrol agents routinely call detention facilities and discover there is no room to hold otms.,Democratic
so  they process these immigrants  many times without even getting fingerprints or running them through our national databases to see if they are on watch lists  and release them into the general population with a notice to appear at a deportation hearing a few weeks later .,Democratic
law enforcement officers then take the released otms to the local bus station by the vanload  where they head elsewhere in the u.s. the number that never appear for deportation is over 90 percent of those released  a number now probably over 75  000 .,Democratic
already the number of otms captured and released is more  so far this year  than for all of last year .,Democratic
it is little wonder that private citizens are taking the law into their own hands to try to stem the tide of otms coming into our country .,Democratic
but private militias  operating without the color of law  are not the answer .,Democratic
we must secure our borders so private citizens do not feel the need to do so .,Democratic
as a former law enforcement officer i know if we do n't have the border officers to stop the otms crossing the border  if we do n't have the room to hold the ones we catch  if we do n't put our money where our mouth is  we continue to send a dangerous signal to those who may wish to do us harm .,Democratic
until we send a signal that those who cross our borders illegally  until we send a signal that when we catch you we will hold you until you are deported  until we honestly face the amount of money it will take to deal with these things  otms will continue to flock to the u.s.  quite possibly populating terror cells already operating in the united states .,Democratic
unfortunately  the leadership decided to include many controversial provisions that members would n't otherwise support if they were n't linked to funding our troops .,Democratic
i do not agree with some of the so-called security provisions in this bill  mainly the stricter asylum laws and national standards for drivers ' licenses .,Democratic
a country like ours that believes so greatly in freedom and the protection of the oppressed should be a safe haven for refugees that are being persecuted by their governments because of their race  religion or political beliefs  which is why we are fighting the war we fund in this bill .,Democratic
i am also disappointed congress has gone one step further in creating a national id .,Democratic
many would suggest that a drivers ' license is the way terrorists are infiltrating our country .,Democratic
that is simply not the case .,Democratic
standardizing a drivers ' license would not have precluded the 9/11 terrorists from entering this country -- immigration reform and better border security practices would have .,Democratic
today 's bill is a start in putting our money where our mouth is  but it is still insufficient to the monumental border security task before us and i ask our appropriators to ensure the necessary funding is included in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill .,Democratic
ms. millender-mcdonald .,Democratic
mr. speaker  as the ranking democrat of the committee on house administration  i wish to comment briefly on key provisions of this supplemental appropriations bill that touch upon my committee 's jurisdiction .,Democratic
i commend the conferees for including $ 2.6 million for taking `` technical countermeasures '' to assure the electronic integrity of the visitor center now under construction here at the capitol .,Democratic
given the status of that construction project  this matter is time-sensitive  and while we have no reason to believe anyone involved with the construction may be seeking to install surreptitious listening devices within the building 's walls and fittings  we know there are people in this world who might like to do so .,Democratic
it is prudent to take reasonable steps against it  and thus eliminate any chance of repeating what happened during construction of the u.s. embassy in moscow some years ago .,Democratic
i also commend the conferees for including $ 8.4 million to refresh the supply of `` quick masks '' deployed around the capitol complex to protect persons against chemical or biological attack .,Democratic
the current masks have a limited shelf-life  and making these funds available now will expedite the process of replacement as they approach their expiration dates .,Democratic
there is no question that the congress needs a new off-site delivery center  to facilitate the secure  timely delivery of packages to the capitol and congressional office buildings .,Democratic
i am pleased the conferees included funds for a temporary facility to replace the substandard site now used  and funds for design of a permanent facility .,Democratic
i trust that given the importance of deliveries to the capitol  any difficulties between the two houses over the nature of the delivery system can be resolved quickly .,Democratic
finally  i wish to comment on something the conferees did not include in this bill  namely  any funding for up to 132 additional capitol police officers during fiscal 2005 .,Democratic
these 132 officers  when added together with 122 more requested as part of the police 's fiscal 2006 request  would increase the sworn ranks by another 254 officers  an increase of roughly 16 % within two years .,Democratic
obviously  with less than five months remaining in fiscal 2005  the police could not hire and fully train 132 more officers by september 30  so there is little reason to include funds in this bill  or even the funds for all 50 more officers included in the senate bill .,Democratic
i am pleased that under these circumstances  the conferees chose to defer a decision about the need i thank our friends on the appropriations committee for their difficult and prudent decisions on the legislative-branch portion of this bill .,Democratic
i look forward to working with them  and with our colleagues on my own committee  as the work of the legislative branch forges ahead .,Democratic
he said all future amendments .,Democratic
correct ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as the members know  all of us in our country want to have our troops to have what they need when they go into harm 's way .,Democratic
sadly  that was not the case in the last 2 years .,Democratic
i hope that the $ 82 billion in this bill will redress some of those shortcomings  shortfalls  that our troops have had to suffer because they did not have the proper equipment .,Democratic
never again should america send our troops into harm 's way without the equipment they need to keep them safe and to bring them home as soon as they have finished their job .,Democratic
i rise  mr.,Democratic
chairman  to commend the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 for putting forth a very critical amendment to appropriate funds for a select committee to study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
as i said  we want our troops to have what we need .,Democratic
we must be sure that the taxpayer 's dollar is spent wisely .,Democratic
in their bipartisan work  the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 have made clear that accountability in government is not a partisan issue .,Democratic
their leadership has set the right tone for this vital debate .,Democratic
in 1941  mr.,Democratic
chairman  senator harry truman got in his car and drove all across the united states  making unannounced visits to defense plants and corporate offices .,Democratic
the people running the plants did not recognize then senator truman .,Democratic
they did not bother to hide the corruption and waste that characterized their operations .,Democratic
this was at a time when senator truman was in a democratic-majority senate  there was a democratic majority in the house  there was a democrat in the white house  and our country was in a world war .,Democratic
but when he came home to washington  truman called the trip `` an eye opener  '' and he soon introduced a resolution to create the special committee to investigate the national defense program .,Democratic
i repeat  at a time of a democratic house and senate and white house  this democratic senator said we must subject this spending to investigation .,Democratic
it was estimated that by spending only $ 400  000 at the time  this truman committee saved $ 15 billion .,Democratic
and it earned senator truman the gratitude of the entire nation .,Democratic
today we are considering whether to appropriate another $ 80 billion to the war effort in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
this is in addition to the more than $ 200 billion that has already been made available .,Democratic
spending of this magnitude demands strict accounting .,Democratic
today it would be impossible to walk into a defense plant unannounced  of course ; but while security measures have changed  our american values of accountability have not .,Democratic
there are honest differences about defense policy  but we should all agree in a bipartisan way that taxpayer money should always be spent efficiently and effectively .,Democratic
sadly  the stories of abuse on contracts in iraq are everywhere : nearly $ 9 billion spent on iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management .,Democratic
the pentagon 's own auditors have now concluded that halliburton overcharged by more than $ 100 million under its no-bid iraqi oil contract .,Democratic
$ 100 million .,Democratic
a firm was paid $ 15 million to provide security for civilian flights into baghdad  even though no planes flew during the term of the contract .,Democratic
this is a disgrace .,Democratic
this may be just the tip of the iceberg  though .,Democratic
we simply do not know .,Democratic
that is what we want to find out .,Democratic
we do know who has paid the price for this waste and corruption : american troops and american taxpayers .,Democratic
our first priority must always be to force protection ; yet sloppy contracting has meant that money has been wasted that could have been spent to provide our troops the equipment they need to do their jobs and protect themselves .,Democratic
recently  we learned that a contract for bulletproof ceramic plate inserts was awarded to a contractor who had no practical means of producing them .,Democratic
it took 167 days for troops in iraq to start receiving the insert  167 days .,Democratic
how many injuries ?,Democratic
how many deaths ?,Democratic
we do not know .,Democratic
for taxpayers  every dollar that is wasted on corruption  and that is what this is  profiteering on the war is corruption  and incompetence  is one less dollar to pay down record deficits or to make social security solvent .,Democratic
harry truman led the way for a democratic congress to conduct oversight of a democratic administration .,Democratic
in doing so  he created a bipartisan consensus that gave the public confidence in the war effort .,Democratic
we can and we must do the same today .,Democratic
the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 would allow congress to monitor the contracting process better  to meet the needs of our troops better  and to safeguard taxpayer dollars better .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and in doing so to support accountability in government spending and to stop the profiteering on the war in iraq .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this bill is filled with many worthwhile expenditures  and i have heard my colleagues all day make various adjustments and amendments .,Democratic
however  the overwhelming amount of this appropriation will be wasted in the continuing financing of the war in iraq .,Democratic
the war in iraq is an expensive blunder with costs now approaching the level of $ 300 billion .,Democratic
in the name of security  we are throwing dollars at a problem which will yield the least amount of security here in the homeland .,Democratic
we are left vulnerable within our own borders  while there is no honest accounting for billions which could make our ports safer  which could increase our first response capacities  which could train expert translators  anti-demolition experts  communications personnel and many others that are vital for maximum homeland security .,Democratic
in general  our federal expenditures for education  including school construction and modernization  could be increased greatly in order to guarantee that america has the most valuable ingredient to secure its future  that is  an educated population .,Democratic
nothing is more vital for the existence of this nation than an educated populace .,Democratic
we neglect these vital needs while we continue to throw dollars into a bottomless pit .,Democratic
this present appropriation might be justified if there were a timetable and a clear plan for withdrawal .,Democratic
through the election process  the iraqi people let it be known that they reject the suicide bombers .,Democratic
the iraqi people reject the fanatics and the zealots .,Democratic
the iraqi people reject the extremists .,Democratic
the extremists can be isolated and paralyzed if we build on this goodwill and desire for freedom among the iraqi people .,Democratic
they demonstrated that in the election in which they went out to participate .,Democratic
to build on this foundation  we must offer the iraqi people justice .,Democratic
justice means a plan to show them how their oil revenue ought to be used to help their economy  and justice means a clear timetable for the withdrawal of american troops .,Democratic
we must strengthen the partnership with the iraqi people .,Democratic
let us stop the waste of dollars and stop the waste of lives of american heroes .,Democratic
we can not continue to dig blindly down into this deep pit of more war .,Democratic
i would like to close with a quotation which i hope all of my colleagues will allow to settle on their minds for a few minutes : `` voice or no voice  the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .,Democratic
that is easy .,Democratic
all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked  and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing their country to danger .,Democratic
it works the same in any country.,Democratic
'' that quote was from air marshall herman goering .,Democratic
i urge a `` no '' vote on this entire appropriation bill which is mostly for the continuation of the war in iraq .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this motion to recommit provides for restrictions on the information contained in the national database .,Democratic
this bill as it stands requires that the database shall contain at a minimum all information contained on the driver 's licenses as well as driving history .,Democratic
this would create no limit as to what other information may eventually be incorporated in the database .,Democratic
this motion would simply protect the privacy rights of americans from a national id database in this bill .,Democratic
in particular  this amendment guarantees that the database can not become a centralized storage place for sensitive personal information on nearly every american about whether they own guns  what guns they own and whether they have purchased any guns .,Democratic
this could be the national gun registry that we have all feared for years .,Democratic
this motion to recommit would also bar information on the exercise of first amendment and fourteenth amendment rights from being included in the driver 's license database .,Democratic
we should not have a government database of political activities of law-abiding citizens .,Democratic
as bob barr  our former colleague  said in the washington times last year in opposition to nearly identical provisions  `` you know something is askew when we second amendment conservatives keep finding common cause with the american civil liberties union.,Democratic
'' groups strongly opposed include the gun owners of america  the aclu  the republican liberty caucus  the league of united latin americans citizens  the american conservative union  and the privacy rights clearinghouse .,Democratic
our constituents have set aside partisan concerns in recognition of the dangerous consequences  unintended consequences  of passing this misguided legislation .,Democratic
this bill would establish a national interstate computer database to track the personal information of every single american  laying the foundation  i believe  for a national id system .,Democratic
moreover  h.r.,Democratic
418 places privacy limitations on the use of centralized data .,Democratic
it does not even prohibit the federal government from sharing personal information with other people  companies  and foreign governments .,Democratic
this system  i believe  is ripe for abuse  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
by forcing state governments to maintain and share files on almost every adult in the nation  this bill will truly usher in the era of big brother .,Democratic
the database could be used to track americans ' movements  store information on political activities  and even store information on gun ownership .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i hope that the rest of my colleagues are not fooled by h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
this is nothing less than a bureaucratic back door to a national id system .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i have two amendments which i will be sending to the desk  and i move to strike the last word and talk about the issue while they get the amendments up there .,Democratic
mr. chairman  last night i testified before the rules committee in support of two amendments i had hoped to offer to the supplemental appropriations bill being considered by the house today .,Democratic
the first of these amendments would add $ 772 million in funding for border security to hire an additional 1  000 border patrol agents  provide 8  000 beds for immigration and detention removal operations  and install radiation portal monitors at all ports of entry .,Democratic
as a member representing a district on the united states/mexico border  and as the only member of congress with a background in immigration and experience in actually defending our nation 's borders  i have firsthand knowledge of the kinds of resources that we need to keep america safe .,Democratic
since coming to congress  i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country  but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the programs that we know will work in dealing with this problem .,Democratic
most recently  with the passage of the intelligence reform bill  congress promised to provide funding to hire thousands of new border patrol agents and create thousands of beds for immigration detention and removal activities .,Democratic
unfortunately  the president proposed his fy 2006 budget and it falls woefully short of meeting these needs .,Democratic
and i fear that congress will once again fail to keep its commitment .,Democratic
meanwhile  every day foreign nationals from over 150 different countries who are here in the united states illegally are being apprehended and turned back on to our streets because we lack the space to detain them .,Democratic
at the same time  we hear of known terrorists who are training recruits to infiltrate our country in order to do us harm .,Democratic
the time has long since come to make good on our border security promises or to continue to risk the safety of the american people .,Democratic
the second of my amendments deals with funding for veterans health care .,Democratic
specifically  it would provide an additional 1.3 billion for veterans health care programs for fiscal year 2005 .,Democratic
this increase is required in order to maintain existing service levels within the va health care system and would bring spending in line with the recommendations of the bipartisan leadership of the committee on veterans ' affairs .,Democratic
the va is the largest health care network in the united states  and it is increasingly overburdened by a large military retiree population  principally of world war ii and korean veterans .,Democratic
that burden will only increase with new veterans returning from iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
america 's veterans have made great sacrifices for us .,Democratic
now it is time that we keep our promise to them to ensure that they get the health care they need and that they deserve .,Democratic
the only way to do this is to give the va the resources they require to get the job done .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i offer these two amendments because i truly believe that funding these two priorities is a matter of urgent need for the good of our nation  and i ask for my colleagues ' support .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
filner ) xz4001330 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey )  our distinguished ranking member  the lead democrat on the committee on appropriations for his leadership for his very important motion to recommit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  before i get into talking about the bill  i want to commend both the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) and our distinguished ranking members on the committee on appropriations and subcommittee on defense .,Democratic
over the years  they have worked very hard and provided great leadership for our men and women in uniform and for the security of our country .,Democratic
there is much about this bill that i support .,Democratic
i have some concerns which i will express but none of that diminishes the regard and appreciation i have for the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
lewis ) and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) .,Democratic
mr. speaker  for the fourth time since the president ordered the invasion of iraq 2 years ago  congress has been asked to provide funds for the war outside the regular budget .,Democratic
with nearly 140  000 troops in dire need of equipment and supplies  this legislation will be overwhelmingly approved and i will support it .,Democratic
a willingness to provide our troops the support they need  however  should not be mistaken for support for the repeated failures in judgment that first put our troops in harm 's way and that keeps them there today .,Democratic
two years ago this week on may 1  2003  president bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed `` mission accomplished.,Democratic
'' considering the events that followed and what has been disclosed since then  if the president were to stand under a banner today it would have to read `` credibility demolished.,Democratic
'' we are in the war 's third year .,Democratic
daily headlines are grim reminders of how far we are from a stable and secure iraq  and the president has yet to provide a plan to get us to that place .,Democratic
we are fast approaching sadly 1  600 u.s. military deaths and thousands of more have suffered grievous and lasting wounds .,Democratic
i have had the privilege to pay my respects to troops in theater and in hospitals in europe and in the united states .,Democratic
whatever our disagreement about the policy which brought us into the war  whatever our disagreement on the lack of planning to end it  it never diminishes the regard that we have for our men and women in uniform .,Democratic
we respect them and we appreciate their courage  their patriotism and the sacrifice they are willing to make for our country .,Democratic
and on any opportunity that many of us have  we express that to them personally .,Democratic
the president 's rationale for the invasion was discredited long ago .,Democratic
iraq remains unsafe .,Democratic
i talked about credibility in terms of the lack of planning .,Democratic
there is also a lack of credibility in budgeting .,Democratic
although appropriations for iraq approaches $ 200 billion  the president 's budget requests no money for the war on the grounds that the cost is unknowable .,Democratic
instead  the president chooses to include a figure for the war 's cost  zero  that everyone knows to be wrong .,Democratic
here we are today on thursday talking about a supplemental with a set amount in it of emergency funding for our troops  and we passed the budget last thursday .,Democratic
it was not one week ago we did not know what the cost would be and now we do this week .,Democratic
this is simply not an honest way to do our budgeting .,Democratic
our troops need relief and their equipment needs repair and replacement .,Democratic
the risk assessment released by the joint chiefs of staff this week shows the strain on our military is real and unsustainable .,Democratic
and it is clear that the figure in the supplemental is really not enough to meet to meet the measure that the chairman mentioned .,Democratic
providing money alone as this bill will do is not enough .,Democratic
a way out must be provided as well .,Democratic
we must focus on quality rather than quantity when training iraqi security forces  accelerate iraq 's reconstruction in ways that give iraqis a major stake in rebuilding their country  and step up regional diplomatic efforts to heal the strife on which the insurgency thrives .,Democratic
i was pleased to be part of the bipartisan delegation that visited iraq during holy week  and i can tell you that firsthand that we have a long way to go to reaching those goals .,Democratic
our experience in iraq strongly suggest that if we do not take these steps and soon  about training the security forces  accelerating iraq 's reconstruction  and stepping up regional diplomacy or as the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Democratic
murtha ) would say  iraq-atize  internationalize and energize  if we do not do this and soon  americans may wonder for years to come if the end will ever be in sight .,Democratic
the funds provided for our troops in iraq and afghanistan  for the relief of those devastated by the tsunami  to aid those suffering in darfur and elsewhere  and to promote middle east peace are necessary and important .,Democratic
were conferees able to focus solely on these issues  their final product would have been much stronger .,Democratic
however  since this bill is must-pass legislation  house republicans demanded the inclusion of controversial immigration provisions .,Democratic
these provisions would be much better considered as part of a comprehensive immigration reform effort .,Democratic
these provisions will make asylum harder to obtain for those seeking a haven from persecution and place a huge unfunded responsibility on the states to verify information used to support a driver 's license application .,Democratic
this is an unfunded mandate .,Democratic
this is an unfunded mandate and it is not part of the contract with america  no unfunded mandates .,Democratic
since this is a conference report  we can not have a ruling from the chair that will allow us to discuss some specifics about the unfunded mandate  the driver 's license application that is in the bill .,Democratic
it sounds like a good idea .,Democratic
but if you are at the desk at the department of motor vehicles and you have now become an immigration officer because you have to prove the citizenship  or at least the legality of somebody being in the country  it is a big burden  it is costly  and it is unfunded .,Democratic
we have given a mandate without the money and really without the consideration that this provision should have been given .,Democratic
in addition  we unwisely vest in the secretary of homeland security the power to weigh federal and state environmental and labor laws .,Democratic
this in the name of securing our borders .,Democratic
securing our borders should be a national priority  which makes it all the more inexplicable that the president did not request in his budget the extra border patrol agents and detention beds authorized by congress last year in response to the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
bipartisan efforts in the senate do more for border security in this bill and were rebuffed by house republicans in favor of provisions that trample on the rights of individuals and states  and may result in the diminishment of the safety of the american people .,Democratic
i commend the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) for offering his motion to recommit to fund border security at the senate levels .,Democratic
he also had this as a motion to instruct when the conferees were named  to add $ 1 billion so that we could have the border security that was recommended by the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
but that was rejected .,Democratic
so we talk a great deal about securing the border  but we are not putting the resources there to do the job .,Democratic
thank heavens senator byrd prevailed with part of the money in the senate .,Democratic
we can do more .,Democratic
we should have done more .,Democratic
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) has been a champion on this issue year in and year out as far as this discussion has been going .,Democratic
again  border security  border security  border security  and then we can talk about a comprehensive immigration policy .,Democratic
i hope that all of our colleagues will give an overwhelming support of this body to the obey motion to recommit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  for many reasons  this is not an easy bill to support .,Democratic
the legitimate emergency needs to which it responds  particularly the needs of our men and women in uniform overseas  are real and must be addressed .,Democratic
a much better job  though  must be done to create conditions to allow large numbers of them to come home and to come home soon .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge our colleagues to support the gentleman from wisconsin 's motion to recommit .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
418 the real id act  because  contrary to its sponsors ' claims  this bill will not improve our country 's security .,Democratic
instead  it will weaken law enforcement 's ability to do its job  and make driving on our roads more dangerous .,Democratic
in addition  this bill eliminates critical provisions in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act passed by congress in 2004 .,Democratic
finally  the real id act makes it much more difficult for immigrants who are fleeing persecution to gain refuge in the united states .,Democratic
mr. chairman  while there are many good reasons to oppose this bill  as i previously outlined  i will focus on the driver 's license provision and the asylum provision .,Democratic
barring undocumented immigrants from accessing driver 's licenses is a dangerous proposal .,Democratic
withholding driver 's licenses from these individuals will not fix our broken immigration system .,Democratic
it will only make us less safe by having unlicensed and uninsured drivers on our roads .,Democratic
the american automobile association ( aaa ) foundation for traffic safety report entitled  `` unlicensed to kill  '' found that unlicensed drivers are almost five times more likely to be in fatal car accidents than are validly licensed drivers .,Democratic
clearly  our goal should be to have more  not fewer  licensed drivers .,Democratic
denying licenses to undocumented immigrants will also hurt our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on millions of adults who are in the united states .,Democratic
licensed individuals are registered  photographed and in some states fingerprinted .,Democratic
this information is then entered into a database accessible to local and state law enforcement  fbi personnel and immigration officers  helping law enforcement to separate otherwise law abiding individuals from terrorist or criminals .,Democratic
in fact  because many of the 9/11 hijackers did have a driver 's license  the records kept by state departments of motor vehicles were invaluable after 9/11 in tracking where the terrorist had been and with whom they had associated .,Democratic
this information was used mr.,Democratic
chairman  there is no doubt that we must be proactive in the defense of our nation by identifying weaknesses in our security systems and making appropriate changes that will protect us from a terrorist attack .,Democratic
for this reason  congress and the president charged the 9/11 commission to study our intelligence failures and make recommendations that would improve our systems .,Democratic
those recommendations were  enacted into law with the passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 just three months ago .,Democratic
the intelligence reform bill required states to establish stringent standards for the issuance of driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Democratic
among the new standards are requirements that licenses contain digital photographs  employ machine readable technology and contain security features to prevent tampering  counterfeiting or duplication .,Democratic
currently  effective and workable federal standards furthermore  the asylum provisions in the real id act do nothing to enhance our nation 's security .,Democratic
instead  the real id act serves only to deny people who are fleeing religious persecution  torture and other horrors the ability to escape into safety .,Democratic
given the fact that an asylum seeker is immediately held in detention before his claim is processed  a terrorist would not risk claiming asylum to enter our country .,Democratic
mr. chairman  real id act is a real bad idea for america .,Democratic
this bill will make our roads more dangerous  inhibit the work of law enforcement  and undermine the homeland security measures enacted in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and instead focus on implementing the counter-terrorism provisions enacted into law just a few months ago .,Democratic
mr. chairman  in a few days we will mark the second anniversary of the invasion of iraq and the start of a war that  in my judgment  did not need to be fought .,Democratic
at the time  the war was rationalized on intelligence estimates of iraqi weapons of mass destruction capabilities that were wrong  and on suggestions that iraq was somehow connected with the september 11 al-qaeda attacks on our country that were never true .,Democratic
the president now says that the war is really about the spread of democracy in the middle east .,Democratic
this effort at after-the-fact justification was only made necessary because the primary rationale was so sadly lacking in fact .,Democratic
the one constant in 2 years of combat has been the courage  dedication  and skill of the men and women of our armed forces .,Democratic
for more than 1  500 of our troops  service in iraq required the ultimate sacrifice .,Democratic
that is a loss for which our country mourns each day .,Democratic
thousands more have been wounded -- their lives  and the lives of their families changed forever by this war .,Democratic
similar losses have been experienced by families in spain  in italy  and  of course  in iraq .,Democratic
the bill before us provides another $ 75 billion for military operations in afghanistan and iraq .,Democratic
this enormous sum was not requested through the normal budget process  not subjected to any hearings  and not counted against our massive budget deficits .,Democratic
in fact  this will be the third largest appropriations measure this year .,Democratic
and this $ 75 billion will be on top of the more than $ 200 billion previously appropriated  mostly by the supplemental appropriations process  for these military operations .,Democratic
how much of this cost would have been unnecessary had the administration taken the time and the care to plan adequately for a war of choice ?,Democratic
we will never know .,Democratic
but we do know -- because these supplementals are evidence of it -- that our troops were sent into combat without the equipment they would need for a protracted insurgency operation .,Democratic
our responsibility now is two-fold .,Democratic
first  to ensure that our troops have what they need to do their jobs effectively and as safely as possible .,Democratic
and second  to develop a strategy for success that will contain clear benchmarks by which the american people can measure progress toward the time when our forces will be brought home .,Democratic
that strategy for success must include an aggressive plan for transferring responsibility for their country 's security to the iraqis  an improved plan for iraq 's reconstruction  and an intensification of diplomatic efforts in the region .,Democratic
other countries -- the netherlands and italy among them -- are making plans for the return of their forces .,Democratic
the united states does not need to adopt their timelines  but we do need clear criteria for judging certain fundamentals  including the capability and willingness of iraqi security forces to deal with the insurgency and protect the country .,Democratic
somewhere between an open-ended u.s. commitment to iraq and a timetable for withdrawal must be a strategy for ending our military involvement .,Democratic
that fact was the heart of the amendment by the gentleman from virginia  mr.,Democratic
moran  which this house adopted yesterday .,Democratic
the president owes it to the american people and this congress to develop such a plan  clearly describe it  and provide an assessment of how much it will cost and how long it will take .,Democratic
i understand and share the frustration that will lead some to vote against this bill .,Democratic
we are being asked  again  to clean up a mess that many of us argued strongly against creating .,Democratic
putting aside our frustration with this administration so that we can provide our troops what they need does not  however  mean that we will forget the mistakes  miscalculations  and misrepresentations that brought us to the point where these billions are necessary .,Democratic
the time is long past due for an accounting for those failures .,Democratic
we in congress understand our responsibility to provide for the common defense .,Democratic
the administration must understand its responsibility to use the money this congress provides effectively  and with a transparency that can withstand scrutiny .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Democratic
1268  the war supplemental appropriations bill for fy 2005  which will provide funding for military operations and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan  as well as important funds for tsunami relief and recovery .,Democratic
the bill before us includes important changes made by the appropriations committee to the president 's original budget request .,Democratic
these changes are essential to providing our servicemen and women the equipment and support they need to help keep them safe as they fulfill their important mission .,Democratic
committed to the fact that the well-being of our troops is our highest priority  the appropriations committee increased funding by 69 percent more than requested for add-on vehicle armor kits ; $ 401 million more  or twice the amount requested  for new trucks ; and $ 50 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents to explode remote controlled bombs and mines .,Democratic
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity from $ 12  000 to $ 100  000 and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits from $ 250  000 to $ 400  000 for families of soldiers who die or are killed on active duty  and we make these important provisions retroactive to the beginning of military operations on october 7  2001 .,Democratic
no amount can compensate for the death of a loved one  but an increase in these benefits that can help a family cope with the financial impact of a combat death is long overdue .,Democratic
when the appropriations committee met  i strongly supported the jackson amendment to add $ 150 million in food aid for sudan  and i am pleased we have acted again today to add $ 100 million in additional disaster assistance .,Democratic
the united states has an obligation and opportunity to assist this troubled country  and i believe this additional funding sets an important example for the united nations and other countries that still need to respond to the crisis in sudan .,Democratic
i have been very concerned about the lack of accountability by the defense department and the administration as we provide them with enormous  although necessary  sums of money .,Democratic
while there has been some improvement  i am troubled that the department of defense has not submitted the required biannual report on the military operations of the armed forces and on the reconstruction activities administered by dod in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
i know that chairman jerry lewis  defense appropriations chairman bill young and ranking members david obey and john murtha  as well as my colleagues on the full committee  have expressed similar concerns about dod 's lack of responsiveness .,Democratic
i 'm also troubled that the administration continues to request emergency supplemental funds for military operations .,Democratic
we have been engaged in afghanistan for over three years  and nearly three years have gone by since we invaded iraq .,Democratic
therefore  it is no surprise that funds are needed to support our servicemen and women overseas .,Democratic
the administration should be building these costs into their regular budget submissions .,Democratic
i am also disappointed that the republican leadership failed to make in order an important amendment by representatives hooley and delauro to expand veterans ' health care and mental health care .,Democratic
our returning troops deserve whatever help they need to successfully transition to civilian life .,Democratic
finally  i am particularly angry that the republican leadership is using this bill as a vehicle to move an unrelated piece of legislation  the sensenbrenner `` real id '' immigration bill .,Democratic
the important bill before us provides critical resources for our servicemen and women overseas and badly needed disaster relief .,Democratic
it should not be used by the republican leadership to fulfill their political promises .,Democratic
i hope the senate will oppose this legislative gambit and confine the bill to address the serious needs it is intended to address .,Democratic
however  in spite of my concerns  i believe it is our responsibility to provide our servicemen and women the resources necessary for them to fulfill their mission and come home safely .,Democratic
protecting our troops  who are sacrificing so much on our behalf  and providing for their families  will always be my first priority  and that is why i am supporting this bill today .,Democratic
i am  mr.,Democratic
speaker  in its present form .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i am a proud daughter of immigrants who is honored to serve my country .,Democratic
i consider it a privilege to be able to give something back to this country that has given so much opportunity to generations of immigrants over the years .,Democratic
like millions of immigrants here today  my family came to this country in search of the american dream : a better life for their children so that their children could receive a quality education  some day own a home  and earn a fair wage .,Democratic
i stand before my colleagues today angered and outraged that under the guise of national security  the republican party is trying to punish those seeking the same dreams that my parents sought .,Democratic
if the republicans and this administration really want to strengthen national security  they should start  i would think  by providing full funding for the department of homeland security .,Democratic
instead  the administration 's budget slashes funding for the cops program by $ 480 million and guts funding for local firefighters by $ 215 million .,Democratic
this leaves our first responders without the critical resources they need .,Democratic
the administration 's budget also breaks the promise of putting an additional 2  000 border patrol agents on the job in 2006 as promised in landmark intelligence reforms passed last year and endorsed by the 9/11 commission .,Democratic
instead  the president 's budget provides funding for a mere 210 agents  a 90 percent cut over the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
the truth of the matter is that republicans are using national security as a facade to alienate law-abiding  hard-working  and tax-paying immigrants .,Democratic
there are 8 million undocumented immigrants in this country who are cleaning our offices  caring for our children and elderly  and picking the fruits and vegetables that we consume .,Democratic
most of these jobs most americans do not want .,Democratic
without these immigrants  our economy would falter .,Democratic
what we should be doing is allowing immigrants a path to citizenship and access to driver 's licenses so they become a part of our american system .,Democratic
this will make our country safer  and it will strengthen our national security .,Democratic
we need comprehensive reform that supports our economy and values our immigrants .,Democratic
if the real id act is passed today  it will deny driver 's licenses to those immigrants and slam the door shut on refugees seeking asylum from blood-thirsty regimes .,Democratic
america is a country built by immigrants  and we should remain a country that is opening and welcoming to those who seek freedom .,Democratic
it is a sad day when republicans use the pretext of national security to attack immigrants who pose no real threat to our security .,Democratic
americans deserve better  and i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in reluctant support of h.r.,Democratic
1268  the war supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005  which will provide funding for military operations and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan  as well as important funds for tsunami relief and recovery .,Democratic
i say `` reluctant support '' because the republican leadership has made a very poor and political decision to include controversial legislative provisions in this emergency spending bill that otherwise enjoys almost universal support because it provides needed assistance for our servicemen and women overseas .,Democratic
it goes without saying  mr.,Democratic
speaker  that our servicemen and women deserve to have the equipment and support they need to help keep them safe as they fulfill their missions abroad .,Democratic
towards that end  the appropriations committee increased funding by 69 percent above the president 's request for add-on vehicle armor kits  new trucks  and radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents to explode remote controlled bombs and mines .,Democratic
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits for families of soldiers who die or are killed on active duty .,Democratic
no amount can compensate for the tragic death of a loved one  but an increase in these benefits can help a family cope with the financial impact of a combat death .,Democratic
i am also pleased that additional funds have been provided for humanitarian relief and disaster assistance  including $ 400 million for sudan  $ 907 million for indian ocean tsunami relief  and $ 240 million in p.l .,Democratic
480 grants for emergency food assistance .,Democratic
but i am extremely upset and disappointed that the republican leadership is using this critical bill as a vehicle to pass unrelated and controversial policies  that will allow the department of homeland security to preempt state and federal laws to build border fences  require uniform national standards for issuing driver 's licenses  and change the asylum standards for immigrants seeking to flee to the united states to avoid persecution .,Democratic
in particular  the bill includes an assault against the matricula consular cards issued by mexican and other latin american consulates  and consequently makes it an assault on our immigrant families who rely upon this form of identification in their daily lives for transactions involving banking  housing  education and even proving  when necessary  that they are the parents of their own children .,Democratic
these provisions why does the republican leadership continue to abuse its power and shut out the american public ?,Democratic
because the republican leadership knows that if these controversial provisions were openly debated in the house and senate they would not pass .,Democratic
only by attaching these provisions to a must-pass bill like the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for our troops in iraq could they hope to be successful .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this is just one more example of abuse of power by a republican leadership that continues to act irresponsibly on issues of importance to our american society .,Democratic
nevertheless  in spite of my concerns  given the choice before us  i believe it is my responsibility to provide our servicemen and women the resources necessary for them to fulfill their mission and come home safely .,Democratic
protecting our troops  who are sacrificing so much on our behalf  and providing for their families  will always be one of my highest priorities  and that is why  once again  i will support this necessary and important conference report today .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
i rise in support of the maloney-snchez-crowley amendment .,Democratic
let me tell my colleagues a little bit about what this amendment is about  and i will try to be brief .,Democratic
it is about providing women with hygiene kits that include soap  aspirin  sanitary napkins .,Democratic
i  like some of my colleagues before me  had a chance to travel there and see what the unfpa is doing there  and i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on the snchez-crowley amendment .,Democratic
this is what the un population fund distributes to women devastated by the tsunami .,Democratic
by voting for this amendment  you .,Democratic
will affirm your support for women and children in dire need of our help .,Democratic
the maloney amendment will aid the tsunami recovery effort by providing unfpa with much-needed funding .,Democratic
it 's a shame that the u.s. government has not offered their support to this organization .,Democratic
i 've traveled to some of the areas hardest hit by the tsunami  and i can attest to their tremendous work .,Democratic
our support for the un population fund should be a top priority  because it 's one of the few organizations that provides resources for the care of women and newborn children .,Democratic
again  we 're talking about soap  toothpaste  and sanitary napkins -- basic needs .,Democratic
unfpa also distributes birthing kits  which are vital .,Democratic
nearly half of all women give birth without a skilled attendant present  or any medical care whatsoever .,Democratic
these kits are sometimes all that 's available to birthing women .,Democratic
for women who have no access to hospitals  we must support organizations that provide these kits .,Democratic
it 's a matter of protecting life .,Democratic
unfpa provides the bare essentials .,Democratic
these supplies are critical to stopping the spread of diseases  like malaria .,Democratic
today  congress can make a  statement to those hit hardest by the tsunami .,Democratic
we can show our commitment to the recovery effort by supporting unfpa funding .,Democratic
today we have a chance to put politics aside and support the ' work of an organization that is pro-mother and pro-child care .,Democratic
helping those in need is the right thing to do .,Democratic
this should n't be a political issue  this is a moral issue .,Democratic
i urge you to vote yes on the maloney/snchez/crowley amendment to help the victims of the tsunami .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
1268  the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act for fy 2005 .,Democratic
my opposition to this bill does not mean that i do not support our troops .,Democratic
i wholeheartedly support our troops and believe that we should fully fund our troops so that they have the necessary equipment to ensure their safety .,Democratic
also incorporated into this bill is funding for tsunami relief efforts for affected southeast asian countries .,Democratic
having gone to sri lanka and personally seen the devastation  i know how important our relief efforts are for these countries .,Democratic
sadly  i 'm opposing h.r.,Democratic
1268 because it includes the real id act of 2005 .,Democratic
the real id act of 2005 would deny drivers ' licenses to immigrants  and slam the doors on refugees seeking asylum from persecution .,Democratic
the real  bad  id act has nothing to do with supporting our troops  let alone national security .,Democratic
it is such a shame that republicans had to incorporate the real id act in the iraq supplemental and tsunami relief when it has nothing to do with these two pressing issues .,Democratic
this is an unprecedented move on the part of the republican leadership and this concerns me .,Democratic
the real id act  h.r.,Democratic
418 will not make us safer .,Democratic
what h.r.,Democratic
418 will do is undermine several key security features that were dealt with responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation which was based on the 9-11 commission recommendations .,Democratic
if the republicans and this administration really want to strengthen national security  they should start by providing full funding for the department of homeland security  particularly the security improvements authorized in the intelligence reform bill .,Democratic
yet the president 's 2006 budget did not include funding for 10  000 new border guards  40  000 new detention beds to hold people awaiting deportation  and 4  000 new immigration inspectors as the bill dictates .,Democratic
the administration merely funds 210 new border patrol agents .,Democratic
as the proud daughter of immigrants  i am pleased to be serving my country as a member of congress .,Democratic
it is a great honor to be giving back to america  a country that has given my family so much .,Democratic
like millions of immigrants  my parents came here in search of the american dream and to give their children the opportunity to secure a promising future .,Democratic
again  i am outraged and saddened that republicans are using the pretext of national security to attack immigrants who pose no real threat to our safety .,Democratic
america is a country built by immigrants  and we should remain a country that is open and welcoming to those seeking freedom .,Democratic
the u.s. has always been a beacon of hope and we must continue to guard the light of liberty for those who are oppressed or displaced .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on rollcall no .,Democratic
23  had i been present  i would have voted `` nay .,Democratic
'',Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of this amendment which is offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 .,Democratic
this is a strong amendment that adds a modest amount of funding for an important function  the function of creating a select committee to investigate the award and carrying out of contracts as it relates to iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
mr. chairman  we are at war .,Democratic
taxpayers are looking to congress to spend their money wisely and well .,Democratic
this is an idea that is rich in history .,Democratic
as my colleague from missouri pointed out  this is not the first time this has been done .,Democratic
this was modeled after the committee created by then-senator harry truman back in 1941  known as the special committee to investigate the national defense program .,Democratic
this committee was bipartisan  and i might point out it was created by a congress controlled by the same party with the same party in control at the white house .,Democratic
that is the situation today  and that is why it would be well to have a bipartisan committee to do just this .,Democratic
we have seen reports in the news media of contract abuse  and i think a committee such as this would help tremendously .,Democratic
we could benefit from similar oversight as we had in harry truman 's day today .,Democratic
outstanding committees like the committee on armed services  on which i am privileged to serve  have looked at some issues relating to contracting in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
we have an extraordinary set of mandates at a time of war .,Democratic
at the same time  there is a significant amount of money in contracting in both those countries .,Democratic
we would benefit from a select committee to review the contracting process  and most of all  the accountability of the contractors .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 for their foresight  and urge serious support for this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i will vote in favor of this bill .,Democratic
we can not let our troops down who are out there on the front line .,Democratic
let me wish our new chairman the very best in his maiden voyage through this body on the floor .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i want my colleagues to know that my vote is not a full endorsement of the bill .,Democratic
i am troubled that we continue to resort to supplementals to fund our efforts in iraq and in afghanistan .,Democratic
i think we can do a better job making sure our troops on the front line have everything they need if we put funding for these operations up front in the fiscal year rather than halfway through it like we are doing in a supplemental like this .,Democratic
i also think we should require more rigorous accounting of the war costs .,Democratic
this is important .,Democratic
we need better information to conduct our constitutional duty of oversight .,Democratic
most important  my reservations have to do with the fact that we still do not have a coherent strategy for success in iraq .,Democratic
when i go back home i get questions from my constituents about the war in iraq and its costs .,Democratic
what is the meaning of winning in iraq ?,Democratic
how will we know when we have won and we can leave  especially when for every insurgent we kill there seems to be another to take his place ?,Democratic
are we trying any more to win the hearts and minds of the iraqi people ?,Democratic
if so  when will the iraqis be ready to take over their own security ?,Democratic
many in the administration have said we can not put a timetable on the withdrawal .,Democratic
i agree .,Democratic
we can not put a timetable on it .,Democratic
but while we should avoid a schedule  we must have a `` to do '' list .,Democratic
we must set goals for the iraqi forces .,Democratic
we must be able to measure the progress of those iraqi forces in attaining those goals .,Democratic
i voted for the resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq .,Democratic
i will vote for this bill .,Democratic
we must win in iraq .,Democratic
but i see no game plan .,Democratic
there is nothing in this bill that forces the administration to level with us and to level with the american people about either the real costs or about our strategy for success .,Democratic
in my opinion this is a missed opportunity .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to vote for this bill  but we should all realize that this is far from a perfect way of running operation iraqi freedom .,Democratic
mr. chairman  today i voted in support of the fiscal year 2005 iraq and tsunami relief supplemental .,Democratic
this decision was difficult for me .,Democratic
i strongly opposed the real id act of 2005 .,Democratic
the real id act has no place on a bill to fund support for our military families and tsunami victims .,Democratic
in fact  i voted against h.r.,Democratic
418 when it was considered by the u.s. house of representatives on february 10  2005 .,Democratic
this type of political game was vicious attempt to portray those who believe real id is a bad policy as unpatriotic  and i refuse to make servicemembers and their families ' losers of that game .,Democratic
i voted for this spending bill because it includes equipment and services that our troops and their families need desperately .,Democratic
it includes additional funds for health care services  mental health for veterans  active duty servicemembers and their families  and financial assistance to help members of the national guard transition back into civilian life .,Democratic
this legislation also provides an increase in the amount of life insurance for troops  an increase in the death benefit for families of fallen military members  and provides additional funding so our troops have the armored humvees and personal protection they need while serving in iraq .,Democratic
with the knowledge we have today about the lack of protective equipment and inability of our system to serve military families  i do not believe that withholding funds from our military families and tsunami victims is the right way to solve the predicament the bush administration has created .,Democratic
i remain very concerned about the bush administration 's lack of a clear exit strategy in iraq and i will continue to fight for real immigration reform and for a clear plan so our troops can come home and democracy can thrive in an iraq run by iraqis .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i 'm starting to wonder if the republican majority was listening to the president when he called for the united states to act as a beacon of freedom for the world .,Democratic
for our first substantive legislation of the year  they would make it nearly impossible for victims of torture and religious persecution to seek refuge in the u.s. and they would get us ever closer to establishing a national id .,Democratic
we all accept that sometimes freedom must be sacrificed for security  but the 9/11 commission itself said that these big brother  anti-immigrant provisions do nothing to enhance national security .,Democratic
this bill makes changes to the asylum process and state drivers licenses  presumably to address the widely-reported anecdote that the first world trade center bombers abused the asylum system and had a total of 63 drivers licenses .,Democratic
however  you have to question the motives of the supporters of this bill when the asylum system was already strengthened ten years ago and the 63 drivers licenses are simply an urban legend .,Democratic
the 9/11 commission found that the hijackers actually had 13  and this bill would not have prevented any of them from being issued .,Democratic
so without making the country safer  we 're going to deny refugees and victims of torture  rape  and other atrocities safe haven in this supposed beacon of freedom .,Democratic
i guess the asylum system  which is the most rigorous immigration process in this country  resulting in 30  000 denials last year  is not good enough for the immigrant-bashers .,Democratic
if this bill were to become law  an asylum applicant would have to provide documentary evidence of persecution .,Democratic
i hope that residents of the darfur region of sudan remember to grab their personal files as their villages are being burned  because under this law  the presumption of credibility would go to the torturers and rapists .,Democratic
the bill would also retroactively make legal donations  even donations made decades ago  grounds for deportation of green-card holders who have lived here for decades if the organization to which a donation was made was later added to a government terrorist list .,Democratic
the last section of the bill then goes after american citizens .,Democratic
the sponsors know that nobody would support a national id  so they 're just going to turn your drivers license into one without telling you .,Democratic
it 'll look the same  but if this bill became law  all states would have to share all drivers license information in a national database  including identifying information  drivers ' histories  and motor vehicle violations .,Democratic
on behalf of the oppressed people of this world who actually believed president bush when he said the u.s. would stand with them  and on behalf of americans who do n't confuse secret databases with security  i will vote no on this bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i would simply like to submit my statement for the record on this particular issue in opposition to the real id act .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong opposition of the real id act .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 is mean-spirited legislation that threatens our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on many adults who are physically present in the united states .,Democratic
the driver 's license real id act will also impose additional requirements on states  without providing funding  and interfere with what is inherently a state responsibility .,Democratic
the real id act will also raise insurmountable hurdles for refugees seeking asylum .,Democratic
this bill will negatively affect women refugees seeking asylum from honor killings  rape and sex trafficking  since most women can not provide direct proof of torture .,Democratic
i do not understand how supporters of this bill can turn their backs on victims of sex trafficking in the name of protecting homeland security .,Democratic
finally  i am particularly disappointed that the authors of this bill have ignored real security threats .,Democratic
like the need to upgrade the safety of our chemical and nuclear plants .,Democratic
instead they have introduced a sweeping new law that allows the department of homeland security to unilaterally strip away civil rights  labor  health and environmental laws to build a border fence .,Democratic
this will be done without any recourse for the average american citizen impacted by the construction .,Democratic
this does n't make our country safer  it just takes away the liberties that make america a model for the world .,Democratic
i strongly urge all members to vote `` no '' on h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the republican majority claims that this bill is an effort to prevent terrorists from entering the united states  not an effort to play partisan politics over immigration reform .,Democratic
i would like to take them at their word  but if this bill really were about keeping terrorists out of the country  why is the republican majority not talking about the real threats of terrorists ' entry ?,Democratic
why is the republican majority not concerned about the complete lack of an interagency border security plan ?,Democratic
and why does the president 's budget not fully fund the mandates in the 9/11 intelligence bill  which we passed and he signed a few short months ago ?,Democratic
why sign a bill if you have no intention of actually funding the items in the bill ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  just one example : the president 's budget only provides for 210 new border patrol agents  even though the 9/11 intelligence bill authorized up to 2  000 .,Democratic
we have caught at least one suspected terrorist who illegally waded across the rio grande .,Democratic
why is the republican majority not talking about the failure of this administration to ensure that our frontline officers are able to check suspicious individuals against a comprehensive terrorist watch list ?,Democratic
more than 3 years after 9/11  why are more of our frontline personnel using obsolete name-checking systems  that have trouble telling the difference between `` bin laden '' and `` lyndon ?,Democratic
`` is this real security ?,Democratic
does this make america safer ?,Democratic
this bill wholly fails to address these and other critical gaps in our border security .,Democratic
the bill focuses on people already in the united states instead of keeping terrorists out .,Democratic
the one aspect of this bill that seems directed at keeping people out of the united states is section 102 .,Democratic
i understand this section originated from a desire to complete approximately 3 miles of a 14-mile fence along the border near san diego .,Democratic
let me be clear : i am not against building a fence  but i do not think a fence will keep terrorists out of america .,Democratic
homeland security expert stephen flynn  who is a retired commander of the u.s. coast guard  and jeane kirkpatrick  senior fellow in national security studies at the council on foreign relations  testified before the senate foreign relations committee that `` great powers have been building great walls throughout history .,Democratic
the great wall of china and the berlin wall went up at considerable expense and treasure and ultimately failed to block or contain the forces they purported to obstruct.,Democratic
'' mr.,Democratic
flynn says that efforts by the united states to `` protect '' the southwest border  including installing a fence between san diego and tijuana  are similarly fated to fail .,Democratic
mr. chairman  it is clear that this is not a good bill  and we are completely in opposition to it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i can not support the president 's request to spend billions more for this protracted war in iraq .,Democratic
it 's time to bring our troops home .,Democratic
next week we will commemorate the second anniversary of the war and u.s. occupation .,Democratic
over 1  500 american lives have been lost along with countless numbers of iraqi civilians .,Democratic
over 11  000 americans have been wounded .,Democratic
the world is still not a safer place .,Democratic
what have we gained ?,Democratic
i disagree with those who claim a vote for this bill is a vote to support our troops .,Democratic
i stand behind these brave americans and believe they ought to have every resource to protect them .,Democratic
how is it supporting our troops to keep them in harms way without a plan to win this war ?,Democratic
how is it supporting our troops when we continue to allow the bush administration to spend hundreds of millions of dollars at will on no bid government contracts with no oversight ?,Democratic
how is it supporting our troops when we do n't provide for mental health services for those troops traumatized in combat ?,Democratic
for all of these reasons  i 'm voting `` no '' on the president 's $ 81.3 billion supplemental request .,Democratic
it is time for a plan to bring our troops home  not give the president another blank check .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
lofgren ) xz4002450 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr.,Democratic
menendez ) xz4002720  the chairman of the democratic caucus ,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill for iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
at $ 82 billion  this is the second largest supplemental appropriations request passed by congress .,Democratic
this is on top of an already bloated $ 400 billion defense budget .,Democratic
instead of borrowing more from our children  congress ought to instead stop wasteful spending on ineffective  redundant and unnecessary weapons programs .,Democratic
a supplemental of this size would n't even be necessary if congress dumped pie-in-the-sky missile defense programs  put a stop to the delayed and over budget f-22 and f-35  and ended the boondoggle osprey that 's unsafe for our troops .,Democratic
there is  however  a larger  more fundamental issue here .,Democratic
the bush administration refuses to live up to the human costs of this ongoing war .,Democratic
over 1  500 young americans dead  over 12  000 young americans maimed and wounded and countless iraqi civilians killed in the continuing bloodshed .,Democratic
the message of my vote against this bill today is clear .,Democratic
the immediate withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq is necessary if the united states is serious about bringing peace and security to the iraqi people .,Democratic
the continued presence of an american occupying force only intensifies the resentment  anger and distrust that fuels the ongoing violence against our troops .,Democratic
it 's time to bring our troops home .,Democratic
this message is lost on the bush administration .,Democratic
they 've sought to establish american dominance in the region and to pursue regime change at any cost .,Democratic
they 'll stay the course whatever the tragic consequences for the wives  husbands and families of our soldiers .,Democratic
these brave young americans face down deadly conflict in the streets each and every day .,Democratic
we honor their courage and service .,Democratic
but  for their sake  everyone of us in this house must consider the burden they bear .,Democratic
is it worth it for them and for all of us ?,Democratic
america is not safer today two years after the capricious preemptive invasion of iraq .,Democratic
terror networks continue to grow and recruit in response to the us ' arrogant preeminence in the middle east .,Democratic
terrorism has been brought to the front door of america : waged mercilessly against our troops in places like baghdad and tikrit .,Democratic
that terror wo n't stop until we get serious about involving the world in solving this conflict .,Democratic
we must actively involve arab states  the united nations and our major world partners in taking a stand against these insurgents -- and in taking our place .,Democratic
a large  multinational peacekeeping force is the soundest way forward to end the war and win the peace .,Democratic
the bush administration can continue to throw billions at halliburton without real accountability .,Democratic
they can continue to look the other way as profiteering trumps genuine reconstruction in iraq .,Democratic
they can laud its new democracy as one of the key foundations necessary to sustain it -- iraq 's economy -- continues to flounder .,Democratic
the bush administration can do all these things  but the end of this war will not come any day sooner .,Democratic
what america needs most is honest leadership and a clear strategy for iraq .,Democratic
that 's not reflected in this bill .,Democratic
its just more money thrown at a crisis we can not solve through force of will alone .,Democratic
that is our problem here today .,Democratic
congress wo n't force our president and his advisors to live up to their failure .,Democratic
we 'll vote to give them another blank check without addressing the fundamental illusion of our iraq policy : we can win the peace alone .,Democratic
that 's a costly falsehood .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to take responsibility for the lives of our soldiers  iraq 's future  and the future security of the united states and the world .,Democratic
vote down this bill .,Democratic
it is time to bring our troops home .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
reyes ) xz4003370  someone who has significant knowledge about border patrol agents .,Democratic
mr. chairman  a better amendment title for this amendment would be the bounty hunter act of 2005 .,Democratic
the amendment gives bail bondsmen authority to round up illegal immigrants and to have them deported without any sort of hearing or due process rights .,Democratic
this amendment would not make our homeland any safer or keep terrorists out .,Democratic
instead  it would endanger civil rights and create fear in the immigrant community .,Democratic
we should not outsource the department of homeland security 's job to a bunch of bounty hunters .,Democratic
as already has been said  the fugitive slave act of 1850 has very similar language to this amendment .,Democratic
and for those members who have not suffered from the ills of slavery and what people went through  i want to share and encourage you to look at this amendment very clearly before it comes to a vote .,Democratic
let us give the department of homeland security the 2  000 employees that we authorized for border security  not 2  000 bounty hunters .,Democratic
this is not a reality program .,Democratic
people will not be watching it on tv .,Democratic
we are turning over the department of homeland security 's enforcement responsibility to bounty hunters  people who have no training whatsoever  who absolutely can and possibly will infringe on civil rights of the people of this country .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i encourage absolute opposition to this amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield the balance of the time to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
farr ) xz4001290 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my amendment mirrors in most respects a bipartisan bill that has been filed by the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 and me .,Democratic
it establishes a select committee of the house to investigate the awarding and carrying out of contracts to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq and to fight terrorism .,Democratic
the select committee is to be composed of 15 members of the house  appointed by the speaker  with seven being made upon the recommendation of the minority leader .,Democratic
the select committee will make such recommendations to the house as it deems appropriate regarding the bidding  contracting  and auditing standards in the issuance of government contracts ; oversight procedures ; forms of payment and safeguards against money laundering ; accountability of contractors and government officials involved in procurement ; penalties for violations of law and abuses in the awarding and carrying out of government contracts ; subcontracting under large  comprehensive contracts ; inclusion and utilization of small businesses through subcontracts or otherwise ; and such other matters as the select committee deems appropriate .,Democratic
mr. chairman  according to the congressional research service  the $ 81.9 billion that is before us today in the supplemental appropriations bill is in addition to the approximately $ 200 billion that has been spent so far since the 9/11/2001 attacks on combat operations  on the occupation and on the support of military personnel deployed or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
congress has recognized that we must meet our operational  technical  and equipment needs of our troops ; and we should acknowledge that the funds for those purposes  particularly those for the safety of our troops  remains paramount .,Democratic
but when it comes to ensuring that the funds are properly managed and monitored  we have been largely silent .,Democratic
horror stories abound .,Democratic
we just heard some by the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 as he was talking about yesterday 's news about halliburton  and there is ample cause to carefully scrutinize the procurement process .,Democratic
just in january  the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction reported that the coalition provisional authority  cpa  could not account for $ 8.8 billion .,Democratic
the report said : `` severe inefficiencies and poor management by the cpa have left auditors with no guarantees the money would be properly used.,Democratic
'' that same report indicated that auditors were unable to verify that the money for which they can account was spent for the intended purposes .,Democratic
the report raises the possibility of so-called `` ghost '' employees  citing 8  206 guards identified as on the payroll at one ministry  although only 602 could be verified .,Democratic
at another ministry  payroll listed 1  471 security guards when only 642 were working .,Democratic
a center for strategic and international studies analysis  which was cited in an october 6 washington post story  indicated that as little as 27 cents of every dollar spent in the iraqi reconstruction is actually filtered down to projects that benefit iraqis .,Democratic
according to the testimony of steve ellis of the taxpayers for common sense  who was citing a kpmg study  the commander 's emergency response program  which is in effect a program designed to allow united states military officers to quickly fund small reconstruction projects  maintained little documentation of how taxpayers ' dollars were spent .,Democratic
the study found that 42 cases were worth $ 13 million where there were no contracts on file and for 142 cases totaling $ 40 million where there was no proof that the work was even done .,Democratic
quoting former coalition provisional authority official frank willis  a february 14 story in the washington post told us of how the united states officials in post-war iraq paid a contractor by stuffing $ 2 million worth of crisp bills into his gunny sack and routinely making cash payments around baghdad from a pick-up truck .,Democratic
even if we accept one member 's argument that this was because there were no normal payment procedures  it certainly cries out for better monitoring and better oversight .,Democratic
we all may have substantive differences about the merits of the military policy  but there should be unanimous agreement about the congressional role in ensuring that our constituents ' tax dollars are being effectively and judiciously spent ; and that is what this amendment does  mr.,Democratic
chairman .,Democratic
it is modeled after the original truman committee that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 mentioned a minute ago .,Democratic
as members know  in february 1941  concerned about possible waste and favoritism  then-senator harry truman introduced legislation creating a congressional committee to investigate how defense contracts were being awarded and managed .,Democratic
the special committee to investigate the national defense program  as it became known  exposed deficiencies in the bureaucratic procurement process  advocating for more effective coordination among the involved agencies  and raised important questions regarding production and cost of specific war-related materials .,Democratic
during its tenure from 1941 to 1948  the truman committee convened 432 public hearings and heard 1  800 witnesses testify .,Democratic
it is estimated their work saved taxpayers over $ 15 billion .,Democratic
mr. chairman  by successfully identifying and ferreting out other defective weapons and other war supplies  they saved thousands of lives .,Democratic
the truman committee was unanimously respected for its focus on fact-finding and its refusal to succumb to partisanship ; and  in fact  the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 and i share that view .,Democratic
the congress has oversight responsibility that can be done without succumbing to partisanship .,Democratic
it is our responsibility in this institution  and we have to maintain this body 's integrity by doing that job .,Democratic
mr. speaker  in this form  i am .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this amendment adds $ 5 million to the operation and maintenance defense-wide account .,Democratic
the secretary of defense  using existing transfer authority  may transfer that money to the legislative branch for the purpose of establishing a select committee  in essence along the outlines of the amendment that i just reviewed moments ago  and i will not belabor that point by going over all of that information  except to say that it would be a select committee for the purposes of investigating contracts and related materials with respect to things being spent in iraq and afghanistan and the issue of terrorism .,Democratic
as i mentioned earlier  this is and should be a bipartisan effort .,Democratic
i think the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 should be commended for his leadership on this and for pointing out the fact that  in fact  when harry truman did it years ago  he was a democrat and the president was a democrat  and he still found it the patriotic and judicious thing to do with respect to the responsibilities of the house of representatives ; and if we are to maintain the integrity of this congress and our responsibility of oversight of such huge sums of money  it would be the appropriate thing for us to do now in a bipartisan way .,Democratic
critics may say that there is no need to create a select committee when congress has standing committees to perform this role .,Democratic
regrettably  those standing committees have not done that  not exercised their institutional responsibilities to the extent they could in this particular congress .,Democratic
the gentleman from connecticut ( mr.,Democratic
shays ) xz4003700 and the committee on government reform has tried  but the full committee on government reform has only met four times on related hearings .,Democratic
similarly  the house committee on armed services has taken up this issue once in june of 2004 at a readiness subcommittee hearing  but beyond that it has not delved into the issue .,Democratic
mr. chairman  there is certainly a need with the billions and billions of dollars being spent .,Democratic
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
waxman ) xz4004250 has been vocal about his attention to this matter .,Democratic
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
obey ) xz4003000 spoke earlier about the $ 100 million found in contracts that were questioned just yesterday  and the fact that report was kept from us at a time when our taxpayers  our constituents and our citizens want to know about these enormous sums of money  and want us to do our job .,Democratic
there is a need .,Democratic
we in congress have a responsibility .,Democratic
the institution 's integrity demands it  and the american taxpayer and our troops deserve it .,Democratic
they deserve no less .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i will vote for this supplemental appropriations bill today .,Democratic
i have been a critic of the bush administration 's policy in iraq .,Democratic
but i think even those who have supported it should be deeply concerned about the escalating cost of our efforts there .,Democratic
if approved  the president 's emergency supplemental appropriations request will bring the total cost of our operations in iraq so far to over $ 200 billion .,Democratic
this amount gives me pause  but congress must not fail to supply our troops .,Democratic
when i visited iraq last year  i met with our troops and it is clear to me that more resources  including body armor and military equipment  are needed to safeguard their lives .,Democratic
the bill we are considering today provides these resources .,Democratic
it includes important provisions to raise the military death gratuity from $ 12  000 to $ 100  000 and to increase funding for add-on vehicle armor kits  night-vision equipment  and electronic roadside-bomb jammers .,Democratic
it includes funding for contract linguists for the army and additional body armor for the army and marines .,Democratic
and thanks to the passage of the markey-blumenauer amendment  which i supported  the bill reaffirms the u.s. commitment to the u.n .,Democratic
convention against torture .,Democratic
it also provides funding for tsunami disaster relief  $ 1.3 billion to train and equip afghan security forces and the afghan army  $ 92 million for darfur and $ 150 million for food aid to sudan and liberia  and $ 580 million for peacekeeping programs  most of which are for sudan .,Democratic
importantly  the bill appropriates the president 's request of $ 200 million for economic development in the west bank and gaza strip .,Democratic
but large as it is  the bill still falls short in some respects .,Democratic
more funding is needed for veterans ' health care and mental health care and helping members of the national guard transition back to civilian life .,Democratic
and most problematically  the house-passed rule incorporated into the bill the real id act  legislation that i opposed when the house passed it in february .,Democratic
i opposed it again by voting against the rule .,Democratic
i believe the real id act does not strengthen national security  but it does create undue difficulties for asylum seekers and excessively expands the powers of the secretary of homeland security .,Democratic
the bill also lacks answers to some tough questions .,Democratic
how many more supplemental requests like this one does the administration plan to present to congress ?,Democratic
what is our post-election strategy in iraq ?,Democratic
can we account for the billions of dollars already spent in iraq  and are the remaining billions of dollars in reconstruction funds being well spent ?,Democratic
why ca n't we get a solid answer about the numbers of trained and equipped iraqi troops ?,Democratic
that lack of information is why i voted for an amendment proposed by representatives tierney and leach to create a select congressional committee -- based on the truman committee that existed during world war ii -- to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
adoption of that amendment would have improved the bill .,Democratic
the failure of this amendment makes it even more important that we continue to ask questions  not only to provide accountability to american taxpayers  but also to keep faith with the real needs of our troops in the field .,Democratic
estimates of future u.s. costs in iraq are mind-boggling -- ranging from $ 400 billion to $ 600 billion over the next decade .,Democratic
that 's why it 's so important for us to do the job right this time  the more effectively we use these billions to train and equip iraqi troops  the more quickly iraqis will be able to fend for themselves  which means a ticket home for our troops .,Democratic
so the bill could be improved -- and i have supported amendments that would do that .,Democratic
but the bottom line is that we need to provide the funding necessary to keep our troops supplied and protected .,Democratic
with our troops stretched thin  forced to perform longer tours of duty and short of equipment and supplies  funding for our men and women in uniform must not be held hostage to disagreements about the wisdom or folly of bush administration policies .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this conference report includes some items that i strongly support  and other things that i think should not have been included .,Democratic
on balance  i will vote for it because i think it would unrealistic and irresponsible to do otherwise .,Democratic
most of the money appropriated by this legislation is for our ongoing military activities  especially in iraq .,Democratic
passage of this conference report will bring the total cost of operations in iraq to well over $ 200 billion -- and by now  two years after president bush prematurely announced the end of major military activities in iraq  i think even those who have been uncritical supporters of the administration should be deeply concerned about the escalating costs  not just in money but in casualties .,Democratic
the time has come -- in fact  it is long since past -- for the administration to be candid about the costs not just of the war in iraq but of the administration 's overall foreign policy .,Democratic
this should be the last time that the administration or the congress pays those costs through a supplemental appropriation bill instead of the regular budgetary and appropriation process .,Democratic
the american people deserve to know in advance what they will be asked to pay to support the administration 's policies .,Democratic
nonetheless  congress must not fail to supply our troops .,Democratic
funds in this conference report will pay for more resources  including body armor and military equipment  needed to safeguard their lives .,Democratic
the conference report also includes important provisions to raise the military death gratuity from $ 12  000 to $ 100  000 and to include a new insurance benefit of up to $ 100  000 for soldiers who have suffered traumatic injuries .,Democratic
the report also increases funding for body armor for the army and marines  add-on vehicle armor kits  night-vision equipment  and electronic roadside-bomb jammers -- and includes funding for contract linguists for the army .,Democratic
further  there is an imperative need for this funding .,Democratic
the defense department reports that operating funds for the army are nearing exhaustion and that it will be necessary to transfer more than $ 1 billion from other accounts to continue essential activities at home and abroad until these supplemental funds are available .,Democratic
in short  the choice before us today is to vote for this supplemental or  by voting against it  to in effect require an immediate halt to military operations not just in iraq but elsewhere .,Democratic
and while i remain convinced it was an error to rush into war in iraq  i am equally convinced it would be just as much an error to rush to withdraw .,Democratic
we do need a strategy to get us out -- which is why i 'm pleased that the conferees included language directing the secretary of defense to provide congress with a report that identifies security  economic  and iraqi security force training-performance standards and goals  accompanied by a timetable for achieving these goals .,Democratic
but an immediate departure is neither good strategy nor would it mean peace for iraq .,Democratic
i recently returned from my second trip to iraq -- this time as a member of the house armed services committee .,Democratic
as a critic of the bush administration 's policy in iraq  i did not go there to confirm my opposition to the war  but rather  to gain knowledge based on face-to-face conversations with our military leaders  the iraqi leadership  an extraordinary group of iraqi women  and most important for me  with our troops on the ground .,Democratic
i am convinced that there can be no successful exit strategy without first doing what is needed to enable the new iraqi government to take up the burden of providing security .,Democratic
that will take time and money  and in the meantime we must maintain our efforts .,Democratic
as the former head of american forces in northern iraq  brig .,Democratic
gen .,Democratic
carter ham  said recently  `` we do n't want a rush to failure.,Democratic
'' so  for me  the need to support the military funding in this conference report -- however unpleasant -- is clear .,Democratic
the conference report also provides funding for tsunami disaster relief as well as for assistance in darfur  food aid to sudan and liberia  and for peacekeeping programs  most of which are for sudan .,Democratic
importantly  the bill appropriates the president 's request of $ 200 million for economic development in the west bank and gaza strip .,Democratic
other parts of the conference report are problematical  particularly the inclusion of provisions like those in the `` real id act  '' legislation that i opposed when the house passed it in february .,Democratic
i believe these provisions will not strengthen national security  but will create undue difficulties for asylum seekers and excessively expand the powers of the secretary of homeland security .,Democratic
this is a controversial issue that should have been addressed separately  not incorporated into this legislation .,Democratic
an editorial in today 's rocky mountain news says this part of the conference report `` has much more to do with immigration than security '' and is just `` one piece of a policy  poorly thought out and scarcely debated at all  and likely to have unintended consequences.,Democratic
'' i think that is an accurate description .,Democratic
the conference report also includes a provision that would revise the h-2b visa program  under which people can come into the country legally for seasonal non-agricultural work .,Democratic
several industries in colorado are heavily dependent on the h-2b visa program to provide seasonal employees -- some in the summer and some in the winter .,Democratic
while most of these companies try hard to find americans to fill these jobs  they have not been fully successful .,Democratic
and the current limit on the numbers of visas has made it difficult for many of them to find the people they need .,Democratic
so  they have been asking congress to revise the program .,Democratic
however  while i am pleased that the report attempts to provide relief to companies struggling to find eligible employees  the specific provisions have some problems and may detrimentally affect some of the companies that have employed people entering under the h-2b program .,Democratic
this is particularly true for companies whose busy season is in the winter  such as the ski industry .,Democratic
they would actually be detrimentally affected by this provision because they do not rehire the same workers every year  and thus do not benefit from the provisions in the conference report that will exempt previously hired workers from the overall limit on the number of visas .,Democratic
i wrote to conferees to urge a solution to the h-2b visa problem that would be equitable for both the winter and summer industries .,Democratic
regrettably  the conference report does not fully meet that test .,Democratic
still  it does make a good start to addressing the h-2b visa problem .,Democratic
i hope that we will be able to build on this foundation in the future so as to protect the interests of both summer and winter industries .,Democratic
the conference report also includes  as section 6063  provisions to reaffirm the authority of the states and territories to regulate hunting and fishing .,Democratic
this part of the conference report is identical to the text of h.r.,Democratic
731  which i introduced in the house  and to s. 339  introduced in the senate by senator reid of nevada .,Democratic
i applaud senator reid 's leadership in having this included when the senate considered this supplemental appropriations bill and i am glad that it was accepted by the conferees .,Democratic
it will do two things -- ( 1 ) declare as congressional policy that it is in the public interest for each state to continue to regulate the taking of fish and wildlife within its boundaries  including by means of laws or regulations that differentiate between residents and non-residents ; and ( 2 ) provide that courts should not use congressional silence as a reason to impose any commerce-clause barrier to a state 's or tribe 's regulation of hunting or fishing .,Democratic
its purpose is to reaffirm the authority of states and territories to regulate hunting and fishing by resolving questions that have arisen in the wake of a recent 9th circuit court of appeals decision that held that some arizona limits on non-resident hunting permits had constitutional defects .,Democratic
ideally  of course  legislation of this sort should be handled through the regular authorization process  and i had hoped that the resources committee would have taken it up by now .,Democratic
however  state fish and wildlife agencies will soon be considering regulations for coming seasons  and it is important that questions about their authority be resolved without unnecessary delay .,Democratic
mr. speaker  there is nothing new about a state 's having different rules for resident and nonresident hunters or anglers .,Democratic
colorado draws that distinction in several ways  and many other states do so as well .,Democratic
and while there have been challenges to the validity of such rules  until recently the federal courts have upheld the right of the states to make such distinctions .,Democratic
for example  in 1987 the federal district court for colorado  in the case of terk v. ruch ( reported at 655 f. supp .,Democratic
205 )  rejected a challenge to colorado 's regulations that allocated to coloradans 90 % of the available permits for hunting bighorn sheep and mountain goats .,Democratic
but a recent court of appeals decision marked a change -- something that definitely is new .,Democratic
in that case ( conservation force v. manning  301 f.3rd 985 ; 9th cir .,Democratic
2002 )  the federal appeals court for the 9th circuit held that arizona 's 10 % cap on nonresident hunting of bull elk throughout the state and of antlered deer north of the colorado river had enough of an effect on interstate commerce that it could run afoul of what lawyers and judges call the `` dormant commerce clause '' of the constitution .,Democratic
having reached that conclusion  the appeals court determined that the arizona regulation discriminated against interstate commerce -- meaning the `` dormant commerce clause '' did apply and that the regulation was subject to strict scrutiny  and could be upheld only if it served legitimate state purposes and the state could show that those interests could not be adequately served by reasonable non-discriminatory alternatives .,Democratic
the appeals court went on to find that the regulations did further arizona 's legitimate interests in conserving its population of game and maintaining recreational opportunities for its citizens  but it remanded the case so a lower court could determine whether the state could meet the burden of showing that reasonable non-discriminatory alternatives would not be adequate .,Democratic
because of the decision 's potential implications for their own laws and regulations  it was a source of concern to many states in addition to arizona .,Democratic
in fact  22 other states joined in supporting arizona 's request for the decision to be reviewed by the u.s. supreme court .,Democratic
colorado was one of those states  and senator ken salazar  who was then colorado 's attorney general  joined in signing a brief in support of arizona 's petition for supreme court review .,Democratic
regrettably  the supreme court denied that petition .,Democratic
so  for now  the 9th circuit 's decision stands .,Democratic
its immediate effect is on states whose federal courts are within that circuit -- namely those in alaska  arizona  california  hawaii  idaho  montana  nevada  oregon  and washington as well those of guam and the commonwealth of the northern marianas .,Democratic
but it could have an effect on the thinking of federal courts across the country .,Democratic
the purpose of this part of the conference report is to forestall that outcome  and so far as possible to return to the state of affairs prevailing before the 9th circuit 's decision .,Democratic
it is intended to speak directly to the `` dormant commerce clause '' basis for the 9th circuit 's decision in conservation force v. manning .,Democratic
i am not a lawyer  but my understanding is that lawyers and judges use that term to refer to the judicially established doctrine that the commerce clause is not only a `` positive '' grant of power to congress  but also a `` negative '' constraint upon the states in the absence of any congressional action -- in other words  that it restricts the powers of the states to affect interstate commerce in a situation where congress has been silent .,Democratic
section 6036 ( b ) ( 1 ) would end the perceived silence of congress by affirmatively stating that state regulation of fishing and hunting -- including state regulation that treats residents and non-residents differently -- is in the public interest .,Democratic
this is intended to preclude future application of the `` dormant commerce clause '' doctrine with regard to such regulations .,Democratic
and section 6036 ( b ) ( 2 ) would make it clear that even when congress might have been silent about the subject  that silence is not to be construed as imposing a commerce-clause barrier to a state 's regulation of hunting or fishing within its borders .,Democratic
these provisions are neither a federal mandate for state action nor a congressional delegation of authority to any state .,Democratic
instead  they are intended to reaffirm state authority and make clear that the `` dormant commerce clause '' -- that is  congressional inaction -- is not to be construed as an obstacle to a state 's regulating hunting or fishing  even in ways that some might claim adversely affect interstate commerce by treating residents differently from nonresidents .,Democratic
it 's also important to note that this part of the conference report is not intended to affect any federal law already on the books or to limit any authority of any indian tribe .,Democratic
section 6036 ( c ) is intended to prevent any misunderstanding on these points .,Democratic
section 6036 ( c ) ( 1 ) specifies that the bill will not `` limit the applicability or effect of any federal law related to the protection or management of fish or wildlife or to the regulation of commerce.,Democratic
'' thus  to take just a few examples for purposes of illustration  this part of the conference report will not affect implementation of the endangered species act  the migratory bird treaty act  the lacey act  the national wildlife refuge administration act  or the provisions of the alaska national interest lands conservation act dealing with subsistence .,Democratic
section 6036 ( c ) ( 2 ) similarly provides that the bill is not to be read as limiting the authority of the federal government to temporarily or permanently prohibit hunting or fishing on any portion of the federal lands -- as has been done with various national park system units and in some other parts of the federal lands for various reasons  including public safety as well as the protection of fish or wildlife .,Democratic
and section 6036 ( c ) ( 3 ) explicitly provides that the bill will not alter any of the rights of any indian tribe .,Democratic
these provisions are narrow in scope but of national importance because it addresses a matter of great concern to hunters  anglers  and wildlife managers in many states .,Democratic
i think they deserve broad support .,Democratic
in conclusion  while this conference report is far from perfect  i think it deserves to pass and i will vote for it .,Democratic
mr. chairman  federal contracts for overseas work have increased substantially over the last several years .,Democratic
this rapid increase in government buying is largely the result of the war in iraq and combating terrorism .,Democratic
since the spring of 2003  congress has appropriated close to $ 200 billion for operations in iraq and afghanistan .,Democratic
the supplemental appropriations bill we are considering today provides an additional $ 81 billion .,Democratic
much of this funding will be spent on contracts for overseas work  and most of these contracts will be awarded to large corporations .,Democratic
unfortunately  while 23 percent of contracting dollars spent domestically must include small businesses  there is no requirement that small companies have access to the bulk of overseas contracts .,Democratic
my amendment would change that by requiring that small businesses have access to international contracts just as they do for domestic work .,Democratic
federal agencies currently do not include overseas contracts when calculating their small businesses goals .,Democratic
therefore  there are no means of holding agencies accountable for providing u.s. small companies with access to international work .,Democratic
as a result  only 1 percent of government overseas contracts are awarded to small companies  and barely 500 of the more than 23 million u.s. small businesses are performing work abroad .,Democratic
by requiring that contracts funded by this bill are calculated in the federal government 's small business goals  we start to instill credibility in the system while ensuring that small firms receive their fair share .,Democratic
these goals were enacted to ensure small business participation in the federal marketplace .,Democratic
however  the federal government has failed to meet its small business goal in each of the last 5 years .,Democratic
in one year alone  this failure cost u.s. small businesses over $ 15 billion in lost contracting opportunities .,Democratic
we have a lot to make up for with our nation 's small business owners .,Democratic
we can start by ensuring that they have access to overseas contracts .,Democratic
mr. chairman  there are 23 million small businesses in the united states .,Democratic
they represent 99 percent of all employers  create three out of four new jobs  and employ more than half of all private sector workers .,Democratic
historically  when the government has needed to build up for military operations  it has turned to small businesses to fulfill its procurement needs because of their flexibility and quick response time .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from california .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
poe ) xz4006520 .,Democratic
gracias .,Democratic
i am sorry .,Democratic
i thought this was english-only here .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i really appreciate the gentleman 's support of this amendment .,Democratic
i would say that it does not surprise me that the department of state would raise a concern because they are the worst offenders when it comes to fulfilling the statutory goals set by congress regarding contracting practices on behalf of small businesses in our nation .,Democratic
i would love to see that the gentleman work with me on behalf of small businesses and make sure that in this $ 81 billion there is small business participation .,Democratic
they can do the work and they can do it more effectively than many of the large corporations that are mismanaging and misappropriating much of the money that has been spent so far .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank my colleague for yielding time to me .,Democratic
i rise today to raise serious concerns with some of the provisions in h.r.,Democratic
418 that have not been thoroughly considered  in large part because the bill was not considered by our committee .,Democratic
no matter what our views are on immigration  states ' rights or a national id  my colleagues should carefully review the driver 's license requirements of h.r.,Democratic
418 .,Democratic
simply stated  the bill imposes costly new requirements on states that simply can not be achieved in 3 years allotted by the bill ; and while states may attempt to comply  the bill 's unreasonable deadlines and inadequate funding will create confusion and frustrate the public .,Democratic
congress previously recognized that states should play an integral role in implementing new driver 's license standards .,Democratic
that is why the 9/11 legislation that we passed just 2 months ago directed the department of homeland security to consult with the states first and then issue appropriate regulations .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 repeals this sound regulatory approach and leaves the states without a voice .,Democratic
one of the biggest problem areas is that the bill requires state departments of motor vehicles to verify the issuance  validity  and completeness of birth certificates with issuing agencies .,Democratic
currently  birth certificates are not issued or maintained in a uniform manner .,Democratic
states  counties  cities and localities all across the country issue birth certificates .,Democratic
in fact  experts estimate that up to 14  000 jurisdictions within the united states currently issue birth certificates .,Democratic
many of these jurisdictions do not have automated records but keep paper copies at the local courthouse .,Democratic
even if they were to begin automated records of new births  they would still need to automate millions of preexisting birth certificates .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 also requires states to verify the issuance  validity and completeness of various other documents with various federal agencies that do not yet have fully automated systems in place .,Democratic
these requirements will be expensive and time-consuming .,Democratic
ultimately the databases will be built that will allow states to conduct rapid verification of these birth certificates and other documents ; but in most states and localities  they do not currently exist  and the experts say it will take a whole lot longer than 3 years to create them .,Democratic
that is why the bill is opposed by the states .,Democratic
it is opposed by the national governors association  the national conference of state legislatures and even the dmv trade association  the american association of motor vehicle administrators .,Democratic
the best timeline estimate from state dmvs is that will take 10 to 12 years for all of the required automation to occur .,Democratic
yet h.r.,Democratic
418 requires verification within just 3 years .,Democratic
in the meantime  what will happen ?,Democratic
states will not be able to issue same-day driver 's licenses  the public will be frustrated  and homeland security will not be advanced .,Democratic
in addition to the unworkable nature of the driver 's license provisions in this bill  i want to raise my deep concern about section 102 of this legislation .,Democratic
this section provides the secretary of homeland security the authority to waive any law for the purposes of building immigration barriers along the border .,Democratic
i do not understand why we need to provide the administration with unilateral authority to waive labor laws  state and local laws  environmental laws  tax codes and criminal laws .,Democratic
this does not apply just in san diego .,Democratic
it applies throughout the nation .,Democratic
i am sad to say this bill presents a dangerous new precedent .,Democratic
the federal government has never before had unilateral authority to waive child labor laws  civil rights laws  and environmental laws .,Democratic
for republican members who want to rein in the unchecked authority of the federal government  they might want to carefully examine this provision  which expands it enormously .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  reserving the right to object  just so i understand  i can under this agreement be able to reserve time .,Democratic
unlike the 5-minute rule  i would be able to reserve portions of my 5 minutes ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  time and time again  the bush administration has not been straightforward with congress  the american people  or our soldiers about the costs of this war and what it will take to ensure stability and security in iraq so our troops can return home .,Democratic
instead of disclosing the actual findings of field reports on contracting audits  troop needs  or the projected cost of the reconstruction effort  the administration has withheld  distorted  and even deliberately hidden information .,Democratic
just this week  despite the administration 's refusal to turn pentagon audits over to congress  i obtained a report by defense department auditors concluding that halliburton overcharged the u.s. government more than $ 100 million for a single task order under its no-bid $ 7 billion contract to restore iraq 's oil infrastructure .,Democratic
i would like to know why unredacted versions of this audit report and the audit reports on nine additional task orders are still being withheld from congress .,Democratic
i have also learned that administration officials violated a u.n .,Democratic
security council resolution by intentionally concealing these overcharges from international auditors .,Democratic
the administration only provided heavily redacted audits to the international auditors charged with overseeing the iraqi oil revenue used to pay halliburton 's inflated costs .,Democratic
worst of all  correspondence between the army corps of engineers and halliburton officials indicates it was halliburton that blacked-out references to egregious overcharges and other key audit findings regarding the unreasonableness of halliburton 's prices .,Democratic
i am deeply disappointed that the house voted down an amendment calling for the investigation of reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan including contracting procedures  possible money laundering  and profiteering .,Democratic
it is disturbing that the republican leadership has been unwilling to assert its oversight responsibility and demand fiscal accountability .,Democratic
the administration has not complied with congressional mandates to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the $ 200 billion already spent in iraq and afghanistan and a detailed assessment of the projected costs of military and reconstruction activities in iraq over the next 5 years .,Democratic
the white house has failed to justify a permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthy while paying for the war with mounting deficits and massive budget cuts to social programs .,Democratic
and when it comes to our troops  it has been congress  not the administration  prioritizing force protection needs and the procurement of safety essentials like armored humvees  body armor  night vision equipment  and jamming devices to neutralize the improvised explosive devices that are among the biggest threats to u.s. patrols .,Democratic
i am willing to support this supplemental precisely because it allocates a majority of funds for troop and equipment needs and training of iraqi security forces .,Democratic
this is a vast improvement over the blank check requested by the administration to pursue its less accountable reconstruction efforts .,Democratic
no matter how each of us feels about the administration 's actions that led to war and its conduct since then -- and i have been one of its strongest critics -- we have an obligation to ensure that our troops have the support and equipment they need as long as they are in the field .,Democratic
in addition  the funding in this legislation for training and equipment for iraqi and afghan security forces is essential for these nations to take control of their own security so u.s. troops can come home .,Democratic
some who oppose this legislation believe that its defeat would hasten the return of our troops .,Democratic
although it is critically important for the u.s. to develop an exit strategy  i am deeply concerned that a premature withdrawal of u.s. troops just after iraq 's democratic elections and as its leaders attempt the difficult task of forming a coalition government would only embolden the al-qaeda cells fueling the insurgency in iraq .,Democratic
i also strongly support other provisions of the legislation to pay for food aid and peacekeeping in the sudan  as well as the more than $ 650 million allocated for relief and reconstruction to the countries devastated by the tsunami .,Democratic
i fully support the $ 200 million included in this bill for economic revitalization and infrastructure development in the west bank and gaza .,Democratic
the end of the arafat era presents a concrete opportunity for the palestinian people to chart a future away from terrorism  corruption  and incitement and toward democracy  transparency  and the rule of law .,Democratic
this aid package is a strategic and timely investment in the leadership of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .,Democratic
the accountability requirements in this bill will set an example for the international community for formulating assistance packages that protect against cronyism  embezzlement  and mismanagement  which in the past siphoned millions of dollars to arafat loyalists and terrorist organizations .,Democratic
and so  i will vote for this legislation to support our troops and to support these other worthwhile u.s. humanitarian endeavors  but we have an obligation to hold the bush administration accountable for its policies in iraq .,Democratic
i thank the gentleman .,Democratic
amendments thereto  meaning to this .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i can not in good conscience vote for the real id act  h.r.,Democratic
418 because  despite the intention of the bill 's sponsors to strengthen our borders  it has the opposite effect  by making homeland security and an effective war against terrorism more difficult with unnecessary provisions aimed at legitimate asylum seekers .,Democratic
moreover  i am guided in my judgment about this bill by the opposition of the national governors association and the national council of state legislatures .,Democratic
this bill tightens asylum laws in a way that inhibits  rather than enhances our national security .,Democratic
currently individuals who participate in terrorist activity are not allowed to gain asylum status in this country .,Democratic
terrorists have not been able to use the current asylum system to gain entry into the country  thus the tightening of these laws only makes gaining asylum status more difficult for those legitimately seeking asylum .,Democratic
provisions such as requiring applicants to prove the `` central reason '' for their persecution or allowing judges to require applicants to produce corroborating evidence are unnecessary .,Democratic
while national security must be our top priority  immigration policy should not create unnecessary requirements for legitimate asylum seekers who are arguably our best allies in the fight against international terrorism .,Democratic
the asylum provisions of this bill will not enhance our security or our standing in the world .,Democratic
i also have concerns that the bill allows and directs the secretary of homeland security to waive all laws which he or she deems necessary to complete the construction of barriers along any and all u.s. borders .,Democratic
some have argued that this provision is needed to ensure the construction of a fence along three and a half miles of the u.s.-mexico border near san diego .,Democratic
however  the language of the bill is not limited to the construction of a fence in this location .,Democratic
instead  it instructs the secretary to waive all laws for all u.s. borders ; this includes the u.s.-mexico border  the u.s.-canada border  and maybe even the border between alaska and russia .,Democratic
the bill also removes any judicial review of the waiving of these laws .,Democratic
this would give far too much unchecked authority to the secretary of homeland security and does not provide the protection of judicial review of this authority .,Democratic
there are two amendments  one offered by my colleagues mr.,Democratic
nadler xz4002890 and mr.,Democratic
meeks  and the other offered by mr.,Democratic
farr  which would strike portions of the bill that do not address our national security regarding the asylum system and our borders .,Democratic
however  in light of their failure  i am left no option but to vote against this bill .,Democratic
i find the driver 's license standards established in this bill to be unnecessary as well  as they already exist in current law .,Democratic
last fall 's intelligence bill  which i supported  included a provision which already implements the 9/11 commission report 's recommendations to create national minimum standards for driver 's licenses .,Democratic
this provision allowed for states to participate with the department of transportation and the department of homeland security in a rulemaking process .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 repeals these provisions and replaces them with standards established without state input .,Democratic
the issuance of driver 's licenses has always been within state jurisdiction .,Democratic
even with the measures passed in the intelligence bill  states will largely be organizing and conducting the implementation of these standards .,Democratic
their participation in establishing and implementing driver 's license standards is essential for these provisions to be successful .,Democratic
this bill simply ignores state involvement altogether in these standards .,Democratic
though the bill does provide grants for the costs of implementing these standards  with the current fiscal climate  many states fear they will be left with the burden of paying a portion of these costs .,Democratic
most states are faced with the same fiscal crisis that the federal government is currently experiencing .,Democratic
creating an unfunded mandate for states is unfair  especially when they are excluded from the rulemaking process .,Democratic
there are portions in this bill which i believe are beneficial to our national security .,Democratic
for instance  i am pleased the amendment offered by mr.,Democratic
sessions passed by a voice vote  as it will strengthen our ability to ensure the deportation of individuals who are illegally present in the united states .,Democratic
unfortunately  the egregious measures in the bill far outweigh the beneficial provisions .,Democratic
thus  i must vote against this bill and hope that the senate will remove the portions of this bill which are unnecessary and attack the balance of power in our country .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Democratic
i will close by saying just two things in points of clarification .,Democratic
one  the gentleman  despite the best efforts of this house  is incorrect .,Democratic
despite our amendment saying no money can go to saudi arabia  moneys were allocated to saudi arabia ; so they are now entitled to discount on purchasing for our military .,Democratic
so our will was not followed .,Democratic
secondly  to the previous speaker  this notion that they are not exporting wahabism has been debunked by the state department as recently as 1 1/2 months ago .,Democratic
they are exporting terrorism  exporting wahabism .,Democratic
i would say they are two-faced except they have so many members of the royal family  they are several hundred fahds  and the time has come for us to start judging people on what they do  not what they say .,Democratic
i have 5 additional seconds to make my punchline point .,Democratic
this amendment will say that we believe that saudi arabia should be treated not as an ally but as an enemy in the war on terror because that is what they have been .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
let me just quote what the gentleman from wisconsin said in the last debate : `` the government of saudi arabia has greatly increased its effort to root out terrorism .,Democratic
it has greatly increased its cooperation in intelligence matters and others with the united states.,Democratic
'' the facts that i read just now were within the last months .,Democratic
it is simply not true .,Democratic
do not believe the hype .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. chairman  when we shut our doors to the world we shut the door of democracy .,Democratic
president bush wants the united states to be a leader in promoting freedom around the world  but we fail at home when we deny freedoms to those who desire the american dream .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
418 fails to reform our system .,Democratic
instead  it weakens our democracy .,Democratic
if you vote for this bill you are saying we do n't care if you have been persecuted because of your religion or beaten because of your gender .,Democratic
stay in your own country .,Democratic
you are not entitled to our freedoms .,Democratic
if you vote for this legislation you are saying that the united states does n't care about federal or state laws as long as it means being able to close our border .,Democratic
who cares if building a wall on our border endangers our environment ?,Democratic
out of 2  000 plus miles along our border with mexico  you are saying that finishing 3 miles of that fenced area in southern california is so important that we should throw out the principles of our democracy and let one man have the power to waive any laws that he wants without any oversight .,Democratic
are you sure that this is a democratic country ?,Democratic
mr. chairman  shutting out people around the world from our democracy and throwing away the ideals of freedom that we hold so dear is no to way to be an example for the world .,Democratic
we need immigration reform but this legislation is not the right answer .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i will withdraw my amendment .,Democratic
i hope that my message has been heard .,Democratic
i thank the chair for letting me speak out of order .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to offer an amendment to h.r.,Democratic
1268  the $ 81 billion supplemental appropriations bill before the house today  that will continue to fund the president 's misadventure in iraq .,Democratic
my amendment would cut funds that should never have made it into the supplemental in the first place  millions of dollars to finance the regular operations of the department of defense  which should be paid for through normal defense budget negotiations  not through a supplemental spending bill that does not even count towards the president 's incredible budget deficit .,Democratic
once again  by funding the war through another supplemental  the bush administration is pulling a fast one on the budget and on the american people .,Democratic
my amendment would take $ 186 million from dod 's operations and management  money that is funded every year in the defense appropriations bill  and split the $ 186 million evenly between the national guard and reserve personnel in the army  navy  air force  and marine corps to augment the meager funds that have been allocated for each of these branches .,Democratic
i offer this amendment today because i support the troops and because i have deep admiration for their courage .,Democratic
our brave soldiers are being used as pawns by their civilian superiors whose wastefulness and incompetence is betraying their duty to keep us safe .,Democratic
my amendment demonstrates the very wastefulness that runs rampant at the pentagon .,Democratic
the fact that the pentagon depends on an extra $ 200 billion for its regular operations and maintenance at the expense of our troops in the field is arrogant  incompetent  wasteful  and downright immoral .,Democratic
let us not forget that secretary of defense donald rumsfeld himself has stated that there is $ 22 billion of waste in the pentagon 's budget every year .,Democratic
the bush administration  and in particular the leaders at the pentagon  have demonstrated a potent lack of support for the troops through poor planning for the long military occupation of iraq  by neglecting to provide every soldier with the equipment needed to survive military combat  and by failing to adequately support our soldiers once they return home .,Democratic
hundreds of lives could have been saved if our troops had not been left as sitting ducks on the battlefield for over a year without enough body armor and plated armor for humvees that can save their lives during battle .,Democratic
worse  our troops are neglected when they finally get home .,Democratic
veterans health care continues to suffer under the administration 's reckless fiscal policies  and america has not kept its promise to properly provide for the health care of our soldiers once they have returned home from the war .,Democratic
the most disturbing thing about the president 's request for more iraq funding is the lack of accountability .,Democratic
why are we writing another check for a mission that has been so badly botched ?,Democratic
who is being held responsible for the misuse of the money we have already approved ?,Democratic
this practice of funding a war through supplemental spending bills underscores the lack of planning and arrogance that have characterized this war .,Democratic
a total of $ 200 billion appropriated for iraq after congress approves this latest bill  that is about $ 675 for every american man  woman and child .,Democratic
so where is this money going ?,Democratic
how much of it is enriching war profiteers ?,Democratic
why did the army waive its usual procedures and make full payment to halliburton despite legitimate questions about overbilling and financial mismanagement ?,Democratic
and why can we not get a congressional investigation into the $ 9 billion that mysteriously disappeared from the books at the coalition provisional authority ?,Democratic
if the president wants more money for this war  he can take it out of something he cares about  instead of taking it out of the hides of the american people .,Democratic
no more blank checks .,Democratic
if we are going to spend billions  let us at least spend billions on the people who deserve it  the brave troops in the field  and especially members of the national guard and reserve who are receiving less for their sacrifices .,Democratic
it is time we honor their commitment and that of their families by providing them with the resources they need and deserve .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from mississippi for yielding me time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  as the only member of congress with a background in immigration and experience in actually defending our nation 's borders  and after being here for 8 years in the house  i am profoundly disappointed at how much we talk about this issue and how little we do when it comes to immigration .,Democratic
prior to coming to congress  i served for 26 1/2 years in the united states border patrol  so i know firsthand about the effort to protect our borders and how to keep america secure .,Democratic
since coming to congress  i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country  but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the kinds of programs that i know work in dealing with the problem of illegal immigration .,Democratic
for instance  just this week  with the release of the president 's budget  as my colleague mentioned  last august we were tough on the issue of immigration by saying we wanted 10  000 new border patrol agents and we wanted to create 40  000 new detention beds .,Democratic
the administration in their budget wants to hire 210 border patrol agents .,Democratic
they are silent on the issue of detention .,Democratic
the administration also has proposed zeroing out very important programs to communities that deal with undocumented aliens  programs like the state criminal alien assistance program  the state prosecutors program  all zeroed out in this budget .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the reason i am going to oppose this legislation is because i am sick and tired of coming here and talking  talking about the issue .,Democratic
i am sick and tired of hearing arguments on who is going to do what .,Democratic
just last monday  i was with some of my former colleagues at a port of entry in el paso  and they were asking me what kind of immigration reform would come out of this effort .,Democratic
regrettably  mr.,Democratic
chairman  i told them  look  we said we were going to fund 10  000 agents ; we got 210 .,Democratic
that is why i am going to vote against this legislation  and i urge my colleagues to do the same .,Democratic
let us have a real and earnest debate on what needs to be done to protect this country .,Democratic
mr. speaker  why is congress approving yet another multibillion dollar spending bill when the previous 3 multibillion dollar spending bills have been misused  improperly managed  and  in some cases  downright stolen ?,Democratic
a report by the special inspector general for iraq 's reconstruction has stated that nearly $ 100 million for reconstruction projects in southern iraq is missing and can not be accounted for .,Democratic
these funds must be accounted for before allotting one more dollar for the war in iraq .,Democratic
and where is the congressional investigation into the $ 9 billion that mysteriously disappeared from the books at the coalition provisional authority ?,Democratic
why are we voting on writing another check for a mission that has been so badly botched ?,Democratic
who is being held responsible for the misinformation that led us into the war in the first place ?,Democratic
who is being held responsible for the troops not being equipped and armed with the billions of dollars that we have allocated to iraq ?,Democratic
where is our exit strategy ?,Democratic
this bill is nothing short of highway robbery  and the victims are the troops and the american people .,Democratic
no more blank checks  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
no more wars without reason .,Democratic
i will vote against the supplemental .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the most troubling aspect of this bill is that related to asylum .,Democratic
today 's laws for seeking asylum are the result of lessons learned after world war ii .,Democratic
after the war  america reflected with shame on how this shining beacon of democracy and freedom turned its back on 1  000 jews who fled for their lives on the ship called the st .,Democratic
louis .,Democratic
we turned the st .,Democratic
louis away  not even allowing it to dock in america .,Democratic
it is estimated that over half of those refugees eventually died .,Democratic
today  in haiti  cuba and other countries  thousands face death  religious persecution  torture and property confiscation .,Democratic
this bill virtually closes the door to those who might seek asylum in america .,Democratic
let us not forget the lessons of history .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to keep the doors open to those seeking justifiable refuge .,Democratic
regarding driver 's licenses  the 9/11 tragedy has been referred to here on this floor referencing the terrorists who obtained driver 's licenses .,Democratic
let me remind my colleagues that this bill would not affect that situation at all  as all of the terrorists were in this country legally and could have obtained driver 's licenses regardless of this law .,Democratic
we should heed what florida governor jeb bush said last year when he was talking about driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants .,Democratic
he said  `` we should n't allow them to come into the country to begin with  but once they 're here  what do you do ?,Democratic
do you basically say that they are lepers to society  that they do not exist ?,Democratic
`` he concluded by saying  `` a policy that ignores them is a policy of denial.,Democratic
'' i agree and i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of our troops serving overseas and h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
i would first like to recognize mr.,Democratic
lewis  mr.,Democratic
obey and the appropriations committee for their work on this bill .,Democratic
this past weekend  colorado welcomed home the 143rd signal company of the colorado army national guard .,Democratic
we honor the sacrifices these men and women have made and welcome them home .,Democratic
we must ensure the safety and well being of the brave men and women who are still serving our country overseas .,Democratic
by passing this budget supplemental  we send a message to our troops that  `` we support you in your cause to bring freedom and democracy to the world.,Democratic
'' i commend the committee for proposing to increase funding for vehicle armor kits  new trucks and night vision equipment above and beyond the administration 's request .,Democratic
this money will ensure our troops are safe in the line of fire .,Democratic
i am also very pleased that h.r.,Democratic
1268 proposes to increase benefits for military personnel .,Democratic
for too long  life insurance and death gratuity benefits have not been enough to take care of families who lost a loved one .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to support these two important provisions and not allow them to be stripped from the bill .,Democratic
although i will be voting for this supplemental  i hope in the future we will not have to vote for supplemental appropriations .,Democratic
i hope in the future we will vote on the funding of military operations during the budgeting process .,Democratic
we are dealing with known and fixed costs in this supplemental .,Democratic
it is time for the congress to send a message to the administration that we must include future funding for the war on terrorism in the federal budget .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to support our troops and pass h.r.,Democratic
1268 .,Democratic
i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
ms. berkley  mr.,Democratic
chairman  first  i want to take a moment and commend the gentleman from texas  mr.,Democratic
edwards  ranking member obey  chairman lewis and the committee on appropriations for bringing this supplemental appropriation to the floor so quickly .,Democratic
this legislation is extremely important to the lives of servicemembers in iraq and afghanistan and their families .,Democratic
as many of my colleagues know  las vegas is home to the nellis air force base and many of the men and women stationed there have been sent overseas .,Democratic
over 1  000 nevada reservists and national guard members have been called to active duty .,Democratic
i have spoken to the parents and families of our men and women who have fallen in the line of duty and i am acutely aware of family conflicts which are exacerbated by the death of a servicemember .,Democratic
therefore  i have serious concerns regarding the application of the servicemember 's group life insurance ( sgli ) spousal consent requirements in section 1113 ( b ) of the emergency supplemental bill .,Democratic
this section requires a married servicemember to purchase a particular level of life insurance and to list their spouse as the beneficiary  unless the spouse consents otherwise .,Democratic
at first blush  this proposal sounds great-until you think about it .,Democratic
this `` one size fits all '' approach could result in the one-time payment of $ 400  000 to a spouse  at the expense of a servicemember 's wishes and the best interest of his orphaned children .,Democratic
we must remember that not all married servicemembers have the same types of families and relationships with their spouses .,Democratic
imagine a servicemember who is married to a man with a serious drug problem .,Democratic
this servicewoman may prefer to name their children as the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy so that in the event of her death  the insurance is spent on he children 's school  clothes  and health care .,Democratic
not her husband 's cocaine addiction .,Democratic
i do not believe that this woman should have to receive permission from her husband to name her children as the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy and that the government should be forcing her to do so .,Democratic
consider a serviceman who has minor children from a prior marriage .,Democratic
he may want his children to receive the monies  instead of his current wife .,Democratic
a man who wants to be responsible and take care of his children in the event of his death  should not be prevented from doing so .,Democratic
but the spousal consent provision in the emergency supplemental may do just that .,Democratic
current law allows a servicemember to designate 50 % of his life insurance policy to a spouse and the rest to a child .,Democratic
this flexibility has given servicemembers the opportunity to properly take care of their families upon their deaths  no matter what kind of family situation they have .,Democratic
the military officers association of america originally supported the provision  but now recognizes that the language is excessively stringent .,Democratic
the organization now supports striking the requirement for spousal consent .,Democratic
i would like to insert in the record a letter from moaa and a similar letter from the military coalition .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the potential of this provision to require that a large one time payment be made to the legal spouse of a deceased servicemember could have serious ramifications for the servicemember 's children .,Democratic
it needs to be reconsidered in that light .,Democratic
i do not want to delay passage of this important bill  since it contains many important and urgent provisions .,Democratic
i trust that the conferees will be able to address this issue in conference .,Democratic
association of america  march 11  2005 .,Democratic
dear mr .,Democratic
chairman : on behalf of the 370  000 members of the military officers association of america ( moaa )  i am writing to inform you that  after discussing the issue extensively with the committee 's majority and minority staff  moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen 's group life insurance ( sgli ) spousal consent requirement  as included in the appropriations committee 's markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act .,Democratic
we believe there is merit to the staff 's view that the appropriations committee 's language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ' ability to make reasonable insurance decisions -- especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse .,Democratic
moaa believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act  and we have no wish to slow that process in any way .,Democratic
therefore  moaa urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification ( instead of spousal consent ) or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another appropriate legislative venue .,Democratic
sincerely  colonel  usaf ( ret )  alexandria  va  march 15  2005 .,Democratic
dear representative evans : the military coalition ( tmc )  a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans ' organizations  representing more than 5.5 million members plus their families and survivors  is writing to inform you that  after discussions with the veterans affairs committee 's majority and minority staff  tmc has reconsidered its position on the servicemen 's group life insurance ( sgli ) spousal consent requirement  as included in the appropriations committee 's markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act .,Democratic

mr. chairman  i withdraw my reservation of objection .,Democratic
mr. chairman  my opposition to the war in iraq and criticism of the administration 's rationale for engaging our troops in this conflict have been well documented .,Democratic
as u.s. casualties mount  it is my hope that the administration will craft a plan to facilitate the timely withdrawal of our forces .,Democratic
for this reason  i am a cosponsor of h. con .,Democratic
res.,Democratic
35 which calls on the president to do so .,Democratic
but in the meantime  despite these reservations  the cold  hard truth of the matter is that our soldiers are in iraq not because they choose  but because they have been ordered there .,Democratic
and they are under fire every day .,Democratic
we must make every possible effort to ensure that our troops return home safely to their families .,Democratic
the legislation before us today provides $ 51 million for `` up-armored '' humvees which protect soldiers from anti-tank mines and armor-piercing munitions .,Democratic
it appropriates $ 611 million for add-on vehicle armor kits which provide critical protection to drivers and crews against attacks from iraqi insurgents .,Democratic
also included is $ 50 million for the radio jammers that are installed in our vehicles to prevent attempts by insurgents to explode remote controlled bombs and mines as our troops drive by .,Democratic
this measure also provides critical increases in financial support to the families of our fallen soldiers .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
1268 increases the military death gratuity from $ 12  000 to $ 100  000 .,Democratic
this benefit provides an immediate cash payment to assist survivors of deceased members of the armed services .,Democratic
it also increases government subsidized life insurance benefits from $ 250  000 to $ 400  000 .,Democratic
the legislation also provides crucial assistance for emergency situations overseas .,Democratic
it would give $ 656 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries devastated by the december 26  2004 earthquake and tsunami .,Democratic
in addition  $ 92 million in emergency funds are provided to respond to the humanitarian crisis in the darfur region of sudan where egregious ethnic cleansing has been occurring .,Democratic
tens of thousands of men  women  and children have been killed during the violence and thousands more die every month in camps housing the nearly 2 million people who have fled their homes .,Democratic
$ 150 million in emergency food aid  mostly for sudan and war-ravaged liberia  was included in committee .,Democratic
with a recent glimmer of hope and improved chances for a resolution in the middle east  the bill provides $ 200 million for the west bank and gaza to help the forces for peace seize this opportunity .,Democratic
this includes $ 50 million for road and water infrastructure improvements  $ 50 million to improve the flow of people and goods into israel  $ 24 million for trade promotion and capacity building  $ 20 million for schools and community centers  $ 16 million for democracy and rule of law programs  $ 15 million for agriculture production and marketing  and $ 13 million for health care .,Democratic
mr. chairman  while i continue to have grave concerns about the president 's war in iraq  on balance this bill provides funds that will help protect our men and women under fire  gives additional help to the families of those who will never return home  helps consolidate the tentative gains in israel and the palestinian areas  and aids the peoples of other nations who face dire crises abroad .,Democratic
for these reasons  i will cast my vote in favor of the measure .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in strong opposition of s. 5  the so-called `` class action fairness act.,Democratic
'' this bill will send the majority of class action suits from state to federal courts  making it more difficult for people who have been unfairly hurt to collect compensation for their injuries .,Democratic
federal courts are already overwhelmed by a large number of drug and immigration cases  and they do n't have the time or the resources to deal with complex issues of state law .,Democratic
this bill has it all wrong .,Democratic
instead of punishing individuals who pursue frivolous lawsuits  this bill will punish innocent people who have been wrongfully hurt .,Democratic
this bill is a payoff to large companies and special interests .,Democratic
it takes rights away from consumers in order to protect drug manufacturers  insurance companies  hmos and negligent doctors .,Democratic
there is no accountability on their part .,Democratic
it is not `` frivolous '' for an innocent person who has been harmed through no fault of their own to seek compensation for their injuries .,Democratic
when a child is disabled or maimed by a preventable error  it is not frivolous to seek damages from the company responsible for the injury .,Democratic
this is a bill that 's going to significantly harm small consumers who want to hold large companies accountable for defrauding them .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on s. 5 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i agree with this bill 's intent to prevent the legal system from being `` gamed '' by attorneys who lump thousands of speculative claims into a single class action lawsuit and then seek out a sympathetic state court .,Democratic
any abusive or frivolous class action is a drain on the system and forces innocent defendants to settle cases rather than play judicial roulette with the risk of a huge unjustified settlement .,Democratic
unfortunately  instead of narrowly focusing on such abuses  senate bill 5 completely reconfigures the judicial system  resulting in diminished corporate accountability and fundamental legal rights of individuals .,Democratic
while this bill makes some improvements to limit frivolous lawsuits  it does so at a price that will make it harder for average americans to successfully pursue real claims against interests that violate their states ' consumer health  civil rights  and environmental protection laws .,Democratic
this is an unnecessary tradeoff .,Democratic
i voted for a democratic substitute motion which would have minimized some of these abuses .,Democratic
sadly  it was defeated and  as a result  i voted against final passage .,Democratic
i will continue to be open to changes that make our judicial system work better  but not at the expense of the people i represent .,Democratic
it is essential that we hold accountable the forces that have so much impact on the lives of every american .,Democratic
madam speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Democratic
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for yielding me time .,Democratic
madam speaker  i am pleased to rise this morning in support of the bill before us .,Democratic
in the two decades that i have been privileged to serve in the house  the class action measure that is before us today is the most modest litigation reform that has been debated  and it strikes in a narrow and appropriate way at an egregious abuse of justice .,Democratic
the bill before us makes procedural changes only .,Democratic
there are no restrictions on the substantive rights of plaintiffs .,Democratic
there are no caps on damages .,Democratic
there is no elimination on the rights of plaintiffs to recover .,Democratic
the bill simply permits the removal to federal courts of class actions that are truly national in scope  with plaintiffs living across the nation and the large corporate defendant  even if the current diversity of citizenship rules are not strictly met .,Democratic
this change is much needed .,Democratic
cases that are truly national in scope are being filed as state class actions before certain favored judges who employ an almost `` anything goes '' approach that remedies virtually any controversy subject to certification as a class action .,Democratic
once certification occurs  there is then a rush to settle the cases .,Democratic
the lawyer who filed the case makes an offer that is hard for the corporate defendant to refuse .,Democratic
he asks for large fees in the millions of dollars for himself and coupons for the plaintiff class members that he represents .,Democratic
rather than go through years of expensive litigation  the defendant settles .,Democratic
the judge who certified the class quickly approves the settlement .,Democratic
the lawyer who filed the case gets rich .,Democratic
the plaintiff class members get virtually nothing .,Democratic
that is the problem that this bill is designed to address .,Democratic
it permits the removal of these national cases to the federal court in the state in which the state class action has been filed .,Democratic
in the federal court  the rights of plaintiffs will be more carefully observed .,Democratic
any settlement involving non-cash compensation will be carefully reviewed to assure that it is fair .,Democratic
under the bill  cases that are local in scope will remain in the state court where they are initially filed .,Democratic
i want to commend the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
goodlatte ) xz4001540 for the thoughtful leadership that he has provided in steering this measure to the point of passage today .,Democratic
the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
goodlatte ) xz4001540 has exhibited both foresight and patience and as chief sponsor of the bill through three congresses deserves tremendous credit for the success that we are now on the brink of achieving .,Democratic
i also want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Democratic
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for the wise course that he has followed as chairman of the house committee on the judiciary in permitting the senate to act in advance of our action today .,Democratic
i want to commend our former house colleague  senator tom carper  for the outstanding work he performed in negotiating changes to the measure which resulted in 72 members of the senate voting to approve this reform .,Democratic
i hope the house will also lend its support to this reform .,Democratic
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding to me  and i will be pleased to provide two examples .,Democratic
suppose that a california state court class action were filed against a california pharmaceutical drug company on behalf of a proposed class of 60 percent california residents and 40 percent nevada residents alleging harmful side effects attributed to a drug sold nationwide .,Democratic
in such a case  it would make sense to leave the matter in federal court .,Democratic
after all  the state laws that would apply in all of these cases would vary  depending on where the drug was prescribed and purchased .,Democratic
as a result  allowing a single federal court to sort out such issues and handle the balance of the litigation would make sense both from added efficiency and a federalism standpoint .,Democratic
now  suppose  in a second example  a checking account fee disclosure class action were filed in a nevada state court against a nevada bank located in a border city  and the class consisted of 65 percent nevada residents and 35 percent california residents who crossed the border in order to conduct transactions in the nevada bank .,Democratic
in this hypothetical  it might make sense to allow that matter to proceed in state court .,Democratic
it is likely that nevada banking law would apply to all of these claims  even those of the california residents  since all of the transactions occurred in the state of nevada .,Democratic
there is also less likelihood that multiple actions will be filed around the country on the same subject so as to give rise to a coordinating federal multidistrict litigation proceeding .,Democratic
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Democratic
what about the amount-in-controversy component  the $ 5 million ?,Democratic
under current law  some federal courts have determined the value for requests for injunctive relief by considering the value to each individual plaintiff .,Democratic
since that value is usually less than $ 75  000  these courts have kept such cases in state court .,Democratic
this is sometimes known as the plaintiff 's viewpoint  defendant 's viewpoint problem .,Democratic
would the chairman explain how the bill resolves this challenge ?,Democratic
madam speaker  if the gentleman from wisconsin will yield once again .,Democratic
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Democratic
the principles that have just been enumerated apply to another provision that i would like to discuss  the mass action provision .,Democratic
under this provision  defendants will be able to remove mass actions to federal court under the same circumstances in which they will be able to remove class actions .,Democratic
however  a federal court would only exercise jurisdiction over these claims that meet the $ 75  000 minimum .,Democratic
in addition  a mass action can not be removed to federal court if it falls under one of the following four categories : number one  if all of the claims arise out of an event or occurrence that happened in the state where the action was filed and that resulted in injuries only in that state or in contiguous states ; number two  if it is the defendants who seek to have the claims joined for trial ; number three  if the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public pursuant to a state statute authorizing such an action ; and  number four  if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for pretrial purposes only .,Democratic
i would appreciate the gentleman from wisconsin clarifying how the $ 75  000 amount in controversy minimum would apply to assessing whether federal jurisdiction exists over a mass action  and  most importantly  explaining the intent of the sponsors with regard to the first and third exceptions .,Democratic
i would say to the gentleman from new york  this is just on this amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i offer a motion to commit .,Democratic
i am  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i have a parliamentary inquiry .,Democratic
mr. speaker  janet huggins died last september .,Democratic
she was 39 years old .,Democratic
she had a 9-year-old son .,Democratic
she had no personal or family history of heart problems  but she suffered a fatal heart attack just a month after she began taking a new medicine for her early-onset arthritis .,Democratic
that medicine she took was merck 's anti-inflammatory drug  vioxx .,Democratic
cardiologist  dr .,Democratic
eric topol  and other researchers at the cleveland clinic sounded the alarm in august of 2001 .,Democratic
their article in the journal of the american medical association pointed to increased occurrence of heart problems in patients taking vioxx and similar cox-ii anti-inflammatory drugs .,Democratic
dr .,Democratic
topol even called merck 's ceo and research director to talk about his concerns .,Democratic
his calls went unanswered .,Democratic
his warnings went unheeded .,Democratic
instead  merck continued to sell vioxx  continued to spend $ 100 million a year on direct-to-consumer advertising  encouraging more and more americans to buy vioxx .,Democratic
that is what ms.,Democratic
huggins did .,Democratic
she was buried the same day that merck finally took vioxx off the market .,Democratic
her husband monty has filed suit against merck .,Democratic
his suit will be captured  along with thousands of other vioxx suits  under the mass actions provisions of s. 5 .,Democratic
this bill is designed to make it more difficult for monty huggins and others to pursue their claims that companies like merck will never be held accountable .,Democratic
s. 5 will make it more expensive for him and much harder for him to travel for court proceedings .,Democratic
it may even dead-end monty huggins ' claim entirely .,Democratic
federal courts have repeatedly refused to certify multistate class actions because they found them too complex to choose one state law over the other .,Democratic
so monty huggins may arrive in federal court only to find that is the end of the line .,Democratic
the bitter irony here is that vioxx claims are not really class actions at all .,Democratic
here is a good example of the sort of things settled by class action lawsuits .,Democratic
this ipod portable music player is all the rage .,Democratic
there are some people out there who thought the batteries on these things run out too quickly .,Democratic
they have filed a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer .,Democratic
if they win  everybody in the class probably gets a few bucks and the whole thing is done .,Democratic
that is what class action lawsuits are about .,Democratic
they do not generally involve personal injuries .,Democratic
they do not generally involve huge losses .,Democratic
there is a world of difference  mr.,Democratic
speaker  between a faulty battery in this  and the death of a 39-year-old wife and mother .,Democratic
perhaps the worst aspect of this bill is that it treats these suits the same .,Democratic
we should strip out the whole class action  the mass action provision  but that is not realistic in this political environment .,Democratic
my motion to commit prevents harm so obvious it can not be ignored by specifically exempting vioxx lawsuits .,Democratic
dr .,Democratic
topol at the cleveland clinic  who i mentioned earlier wrote  `` neither of the two major forces in this 5-and-a-half year affair  neither merck nor the fda  fulfilled its responsibilities to the public.,Democratic
'' this motion to commit offers an opportunity for someone at last to act responsibly .,Democratic
if we adopt this motion to commit  monty huggins will have a fighting chance for justice .,Democratic
if we do not  the u.s. house of representatives will join the list of those who betrayed the public 's trust .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield the reminder of my time to my friend  the gentleman from arkansas ( mr.,Democratic
ross ) xz4003450 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of the bipartisan amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Democratic
leach ) xz4002360 .,Democratic
i support this amendment because it will address an issue that is of paramount importance to the people in my district and i think across the country  supporting our troops while being fiscally responsible .,Democratic
i recently returned from iraq and a bipartisan delegation led by the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr.,Democratic
cole ) xz4000770 .,Democratic
my visit convinced me that the reestablishment of the truman committee is the right thing for our troops  for the taxpayers and for our country .,Democratic
the original truman committee was a special committee formed on march 1  1941 to investigate the national defense program .,Democratic
it was chaired by missouri 's u.s. senator at that time  harry truman .,Democratic
its specific directive was to investigate the terms of defense-related contracts  the methods of awarding them  the effect on labor and the geographic distribution of contracts and facilities .,Democratic
during world war ii  the committee 's principal concern was to monitor and improve production programs and contract procedures .,Democratic
its work resulted in the discovery and exposure of waste and mismanagement in the wartime production program .,Democratic
by convening public hearings at that time and receiving testimony and studying this issue  the truman commission is estimated to have saved american taxpayers $ 15 billion .,Democratic
similarly today  we owe it to our troops to carefully watch how we are funding the iraq initiative .,Democratic
it is our responsibility to ensure that every man and woman in uniform has the necessary equipment to do the job with the best possible support .,Democratic
we have an obligation to every troop that no appropriated money is misspent or wasted .,Democratic
while the morale of our troops is high and their optimism apparent after the recent elections in iraq  it is imperative that we do everything in our power to ensure that they are brought home as quickly as possible .,Democratic
ensuring that there is no waste or mismanagement in any of our funding  i have no doubt that a modern day truman committee will help bring our troops home quickly  safely and in a fiscally responsible way .,Democratic
i believe we can support our troops  give them what they need  and help them return home soon .,Democratic
i strongly support this amendment for the funding of the truman committee .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of the maloney amendment because we must break the deadly political impasse that endangers the health of women around the world .,Democratic
the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) has the ability to provide health services and promote maternal health globally .,Democratic
yet we deny them funding  choosing to focus on narrow ideological disagreements and not the lifesaving potential of their work .,Democratic
we simply can not afford more delay .,Democratic
we must seek common ground and that is what the maloney amendment will do .,Democratic
disasters put pregnant women at greater than normal risk because of the sudden loss of medical support  compounded in many cases by trauma  malnutrition  disease or exposure to violence .,Democratic
we all know that the tsunami took away valuable medical care for women across the affected areas in southeast asia .,Democratic
without unfpa we would n't have been able to calculate that 150  000 women are currently pregnant in this region .,Democratic
without unfpa these women would not have the guarantee of safe  clean environments to deliver their babies .,Democratic
they would not have access to the medical support and medicines they need to ensure a healthy birth .,Democratic
safe and healthy childbirth should not be a political issue .,Democratic
while disagreements about unfpa will certainly remain  continuing to ensure this program is there to rely on has never been more important .,Democratic
in such a polarized political environment  we must not sacrifice this opportunity to move forward and renew our commitment to promote the health of women around the world .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the maloney amendment .,Democratic
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
madam speaker  with the consideration of this legislation  the majority begins their assault on our nation 's civil justice system .,Democratic
today we will attempt to preempt state class actions .,Democratic
next month we will take up a bankruptcy bill that massively tilts the playing field in favor of credit card companies and against ordinary consumers and workers alike .,Democratic
on deck and pending are equally one-sided medical malpractice bills and asbestos bills that both cap damages and eliminate liability to protect some of the most egregious wrongdoers in america .,Democratic
the majority 's assault on victims and consumers is unprecedented in its scope and stunning in its breadth .,Democratic
collectively  these measures will close the courthouse doors on millions of americans harmed by intentional wrongdoing  negligence  and fraud .,Democratic
and so  long after the 109th congress has forgotten  american consumers and workers will be paying the price for these special interest bills through needless injuries and uncompensated harm .,Democratic
this legislation will remove class actions involving state law issues from state courts  the forum most convenient for victims of wrongdoing and with the judges most familiar with the substantive law  and this legislation will move it to the federal courts where the case will take far longer to resolve and is far less likely to be certified .,Democratic
now  you do not need to take my word for it .,Democratic
let us just ask big business itself .,Democratic
the nation 's largest bank  citicorp admits `` the practical effect ( of the bill will ) be that many cases will never be heard .,Democratic
federal judges facing overburdened dockets and ambiguities about applying state laws in a federal court  often refuse to grant standing to class action plaintiffs.,Democratic
'' forbes magazine writes  `` the legislation will ... ..,Democratic
make it more difficult for plaintiffs to prevail  since ... ..,Democratic
federal courts are ... ..,Democratic
less open to considering ... ..,Democratic
class action claims.,Democratic
'' passage of this legislation would be particularly devastating for civil rights cases and labor law cases .,Democratic
as the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law explained  `` the consequences of the legislation for civil rights class actions ... ..,Democratic
will be astounding and  in our view  disastrous .,Democratic
redirecting state law class actions to the federal courts will choke federal court dockets and delay or foreclose the timely and effective determination of federal ( civil rights ) cases.,Democratic
'' since the november election we have heard a lot of talk about values  and that is fine ; but will someone during this discourse today tell me where the value is in denying senior citizens who suffered heart attacks because they took vioxx for their arthritis ?,Democratic
where is the morality in preventing poor workers from joining together to obtain compensation when unscrupulous employers pay them slave-labor wages ?,Democratic
where is the righteousness in telling victims of discrimination that they will have to wait years for a federal court to consider violations of their own state laws ?,Democratic
if we have learned anything from the enron  tyco  firestone  and other legal debacles  it is that our citizens need more protection against wrongdoers in our society  not less .,Democratic
and yet the class action bill before us takes us in precisely the opposite direction .,Democratic
the house should reject this one-sided  anti-consumer and anti-civil rights legislation .,Democratic
madam speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
madam speaker  i yield myself as much time as i may consume .,Democratic
the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
boucher ) is a dear friend of mine  and i merely want to take one observation that he made  that this is just a procedural process and that there is no substantive changes  but i say to him  if the legal system is rigged and the rules are stacked against you  you never have to get to the substance ; you do not even get your day in court .,Democratic
that is the problem with this bill .,Democratic
it is a procedural process that prevents people from bringing actions in state courts  and we are sending it to the federal courts when both the federal judiciary has spoken against this measure and the state judges have spoken against this measure as well .,Democratic
i think that that should be a very instructive criticism against this bill .,Democratic
the proposal before us is opposed by both state and federal judiciaries .,Democratic
it is opposed by the national council of state legislatures ; consumers and public interest groups  including public citizen  the consumers federation of america  the consumers union  the united states pirg ; a coalition of environmental advocates ; health advocates  including the campaign for tobacco free kids ; civil rights groups such as the alliance for justice  the leadership conference on civil rights  the national association for the advancement of colored people  and the lawyers ' committee for civil rights and labor such as the american federation of labor-congress of industrial organizations  afl-cio .,Democratic
this legislation is also opposed by many of the nation 's editorial boards in the newspaper business .,Democratic
a new york times editorial board just this weekend wrote this about the measure that is before the house today : `` instead of narrowly focusing on real abuses of the system  the measure reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback of corporate accountability and people 's rights .,Democratic
the main impact of the bill  which has the sort of propagandistic title normally assigned to such laws  the class action fairness act  will be to funnel nearly all major class action lawsuits out of state courts and into already overburdened federal courts .,Democratic
that will inevitably make it harder for americans to pursue legitimate claims successfully against companies that violate state consumer  health  civil rights and environmental protection laws.,Democratic
'' madam speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i demand a recorded vote .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to my good friend  the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
markey ) from the committee on energy and commerce .,Democratic
he has worked with us on many of these issues .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003641 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from north carolina ( mr.,Democratic
watt ) xz4004240 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
moran ) xz4002831 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself 1 minute .,Democratic
i would like to respond to my good friend  the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
moran ) xz4002831 .,Democratic
first of all  i think the naacp and the civil rights groups will be eager to find out that his wisdom is superior to their experience in the civil rights movement .,Democratic
what the gentleman was suggesting may have been correct a number of years ago  but i would point out to the gentleman that the federal courts more recently have not been as desirable a forum for civil rights activities .,Democratic
the bank of boston case  that was 10 years ago and an anomaly .,Democratic
there are not other examples of class actions where class members lost money .,Democratic
no other court has made the same mistake .,Democratic
i would urge that neither the gentleman nor any of us rewrite class action rules because of one mistake .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
inslee ) xz4001930 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i have a parliamentary inquiry .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i would like to briefly describe why this substitute is the superior piece of legislation before us today .,Democratic
the substitute is much better for the following reasons : civil rights carve-out .,Democratic
the substitute would carve out state civil rights claims in order to make sure that civil rights plaintiffs  especially those seeking immediate injunctive relief  can have their grievances addressed in a timely manner .,Democratic
believe me  this is an issue of great moment to those of us who are still prosecuting for a fair day in our nation and have civil rights laws to back us up  but we now are pleading to keep the proper forums .,Democratic
for example  every state in the union has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability .,Democratic
the language does not affect the federal jurisdiction over federal claims .,Democratic
the second consideration for this is the wage-and-hour carve-out .,Democratic
wage-and-hour class actions are often brought in state courts because state wage-and-hour remedies are often  i am sorry to say  more complete than the federal wage-and-hour statute ; and we have examples of that .,Democratic
the third reason : we exclude non-class action cases involving physical injuries .,Democratic
the measure before us applies not only to class actions  but also to mass torts .,Democratic
the democratic substitute removes the mass tort language .,Democratic
and then  of course  the attorney general carve-out which clarifies cases brought by state attorneys general are excluded from the provisions of the class action bill and would not be forced into federal court .,Democratic
these are the major reasons why we encourage a supportive vote for the substitute to the measure that is being debated today .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003641 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
pelosi ) xz4003140  the minority leader of our caucus .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890  a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
weiner ) xz4004260  a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
weiner ) xz4004260 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990  a cosponsor of the substitute amendment .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we have listened carefully to the discussion here  and it is very clear that one thing is for sure : this is not a simple procedural fix to class actions in our courts .,Democratic
another thing  it is clear that all of the totally unsatisfactory provisions have not been removed .,Democratic
first  the bill  as the gentlewoman from texas has said  harms working americans and victims of discrimination who are in no position to bring individual actions of wage-and-hour cases or civil rights discrimination claims .,Democratic
moving the cases to federal court will result in many never being ever heard at all .,Democratic
many state laws provide better protection than federal statutes .,Democratic
for example  20 states provide protection for marital status and federal law does not .,Democratic
twenty-one states extend federal definitions of national origin discrimination by including ancestry  place of birth  and citizenship status ; and 31 states prohibit genetic discrimination in the workplace  not provided under federal law .,Democratic
secondly  this bill closes the door on victims of large-scale personal injury cases resulting from accidents  environmental disasters  or dangerous drugs that are widely sold .,Democratic
although these cases are filed in state courts under state law  the bill will treat them as class actions and throw them willy-nilly into the federal court .,Democratic
while harming victims of personal injury  this provision greatly helps the companies  like merck  the company that manufactured the deadly drug vioxx .,Democratic
since the discovery of the dangers of vioxx  hundreds of cases from all over the country have been filed against merck  and we can anticipate likely thousands more .,Democratic
however  under this proposal before us today  those who suffered harm from the drug will be denied their day in court and their ability to seek justice .,Democratic
finally  this bill makes it difficult for consumers to pursue claims against defendants who violated consumer protection laws .,Democratic
the bill will force many of these cases filed in state courts into the federal system .,Democratic
but some federal courts will not certify class actions involving the laws of multiple states because they deem the case too complex and unmanageable .,Democratic
result : harmed consumers will never have their cases adjudicated in the courts .,Democratic
it also makes it impossible for states to pursue actions against defendants who have caused harm to the state 's citizens .,Democratic
state attorneys general often pursue these claims under state consumer protection statutes  antitrust laws  often with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state .,Democratic
under this bill  would we want these cases to be thrown into federal court and severely impede the state 's ability to enforce its own laws for its own citizens ?,Democratic
that is what will happen .,Democratic
that is what will take place .,Democratic
so i am very pleased to put in the record the letter from the states attorneys general opposing this legislation  those attorneys general from california  illinois  iowa  kentucky  maine  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  new jersey  new mexico  new york  oklahoma  oregon  vermont  and west virginia .,Democratic
i would also like to add the letter from the environmental organizations which have made their case as to why this would be a very harmful measure .,Democratic
the signatories of this letter include the united states public interest research group  pirg ; the wilderness society ; the sierra club ; the national environment trust ; greenpeace ; friends of the earth ; and the national audubon society  and many others .,Democratic
finally  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i include in this debate from the leadership conference and the afl-cio  and the alliance for justice  all writing on one letter  and they plead with us in the house of representatives to protect working men and women and civil rights litigants by opposing the measure that is before us .,Democratic
washington  dc  february 15  2005 .,Democratic
dear representative : on behalf of the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations  we write to urge you to vote against the class action fairness act ( s. 5 )  which passed the senate last week .,Democratic
while the bill was pending before the senate  we pushed for an amendment offered by senator kennedy that would have exempted civil rights and wage and hour state law cases .,Democratic
because the amendment was not adopted  we ask you to reject s. 5 in order to ensure that the class action fairness act does not adversely impact the workplace and civil rights of ordinary americans by making it extremely difficult to enforce civil rights and labor rights .,Democratic
during congress ' extensive examination into the merits of class action lawsuits  nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in anti-discrimination and wage and hour class-action litigation .,Democratic
by allowing dozens of employees to bring one lawsuit together  the class-action device is frequently the only means for low wage workers who have been denied mere dollars a day to recover their lost wages .,Democratic
moreover  class actions also are often the only means to effectively change a policy of discrimination .,Democratic
these suits level the playing field between individuals and those with more power and resources  and permit courts to decide cases more efficiently .,Democratic
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in state courts under the law of the state in which the claims arise .,Democratic
the reason is that state wage and hour laws typically provide more complete remedies for victims of wage and hour violations than the federal wage and hour statute .,Democratic
for instance  the federal fair labor standards act ( flsa ) offers no protection for a worker who works 30 hours and is paid for 20  so long as the worker 's total pay for the 30 hours worked exceeds the federal minimum wage .,Democratic
however  many states have `` payment of wage '' laws that would require that the worker be fully paid for those additional 10 hours of work .,Democratic
also  federal law provides no remedy for part-time workers who often work 10-16 hour days  yet earn no overtime because they work less than 40 hours per week .,Democratic
at least six states and territories  however  including california and alaska  require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours are worked in a single day .,Democratic
likewise  state laws increasingly provide greater civil rights protection than federal law .,Democratic
for example  every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability .,Democratic
some of these state statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act including california  minnesota  new jersey  new york  rhode island  washington  and west virginia .,Democratic
in addition  every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment  and some of these state laws -- including those of california  michigan  ohio and the district of columbia -- contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination in employment act ( adea ) .,Democratic
in addition  many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law .,Democratic
for example  the following states provide protection for marital status : alaska  california  connecticut  delaware  florida  hawaii  illinois  maryland  michigan  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north dakota  oregon  virginia  washington  and wisconsin .,Democratic
moreover  several states have expanded title vii 's ban on national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ancestry  or place of birth  or citizenship status .,Democratic
these states include arkansas  california  colorado  connecticut  hawaii  illinois  indiana  kansas  maine  massachusetts  missouri  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  south dakota  vermont  west virginia  wisconsin  wyoming  and the virgin islands .,Democratic
finally  31 states have enacted legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination in the workplace -- an important protection given the rapid increase in the ability to gather this type of information .,Democratic
the 31 states are arizona  arkansas  california  connecticut  delaware  hawaii  iowa  kansas  louisiana  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  nevada  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north carolina  oklahoma  oregon  rhode island  south dakota  texas  utah  vermont  virginia  washington  and wisconsin .,Democratic
in addition  florida and illinois have enacted more limited protections against genetic discrimination .,Democratic
under s. 5  citizens are denied the right to use their own state courts to bring class actions against corporations that violate these state wage and hour and state civil rights laws  even where that corporation has hundreds of employees in that state .,Democratic
moving these state law cases into federal court will delay and likely deny justice for working men and women and victims of discrimination .,Democratic
the federal courts are already overburdened .,Democratic
additionally  federal courts are less likely to certify classes or provide relief for violations of state law .,Democratic
in light of the lack of any compelling need to sweep state wage and hour and civil rights claims into the scope of the bill  which is done in the current bill  we urge you to vote against s. 5 .,Democratic
in the event that amendments are offered  we support any amendment that  like the kennedy amendment and others offered in the senate  preserves the right of individuals to bring class actions in an effective  efficient manner .,Democratic

february 7  2005 .,Democratic
dear senator : our organizations are opposed to the sweepingly-drawn and misleadingly named `` class action fairness act of 2005.,Democratic
'' this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills  contaminated drinking water  polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws .,Democratic
s. 5 would allow corporate defendants in many pollution class actions and `` mass tort '' environmental cases to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from state court to federal court  placing the cases in a forum that could be more costly  more time-consuming  and disadvantageous to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution .,Democratic
state law environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the class action bill .,Democratic
class actions protect the public 's health and the environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication of their cases .,Democratic
all too often  hazardous spills  water pollution  or other toxic contamination from a single source affects large numbers of people  not all of whom may be citizens or residents of the same state as that of the defendants who caused the harm .,Democratic
in such cases  a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence  nuisance or trespass  or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur  is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims .,Democratic
for example  thousands of families around the country are now suffering because of widespread groundwater contamination caused by the gasoline additive mtbe  which the u.s. government considers a potential human carcinogen .,Democratic
according to a may  2002 gao report  35 states reported that they find mtbe in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they sample for it  and 24 states said that they find it at least 60 percent of the time .,Democratic
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable  but under this bill  mtbe class actions or `` mass actions '' based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases .,Democratic
this could not only make these cases more expensive  more time-consuming and more difficult for injured parties  but could also result in the dismissal of legitimate cases by federal judges who are unfamiliar with  or less respectful of  state-law claims .,Democratic
for example  in at least one mtbe class action  a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies ' claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act ( even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe ) .,Democratic
yet a california state court rejected a similar federal preemption argument and let the case go to .,Democratic
a jury  which found oil refineries  fuel distributors  and others liable for damages .,Democratic
these cases highlight how a state court may be more willing to uphold legitimate state law claims .,Democratic
other examples of state-law cases that would be weakened by this bill include lead contamination cases  mercury contamination  perchlorate pollution and other `` toxic tort '' cases .,Democratic
in a letter to the senate last year  the u.s. judicial conference expressed their continued opposition to such broadly written class action removal legislation .,Democratic
notably  their letter states that  even if congress determines that some `` significant multi-state class actions '' should be brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal courts  congress should include certain limitations and exceptions  including for class actions `` in which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or personal property damage within the state  as in the case of a serious environmental disaster.,Democratic
'' the judicial conference 's letter explains that this `` environmental harm '' exception should apply `` to all individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property  whether or not they were citizens of the state in question.,Democratic
'' we agree with the judicial conference that cases involving environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases that proponents of s. 5 cite when they call for reforms to the class action system .,Democratic
including such cases in the bill penalizes injured parties in those cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters .,Democratic
no rationale has been offered by the bill 's supporters for including environmental cases in s. 5 's provisions .,Democratic
we are unaware of any examples offered by bill supporters of environmental harm cases that represent alleged abuses of the state class actions .,Democratic
more proof of the overreaching of this bill is that the so-called `` class action fairness act '' is not even limited to class action cases .,Democratic
the bill contains a provision that would allow defendants to remove to federal court all environmental `` mass action '' cases involving more than 100 people -- even though these cases are not even filed as class actions .,Democratic
for example  the bill would apply to cases similar to the recently concluded state-court trial in anniston  alabama  where a jury awarded damages to be paid by monsanto and solutia for injuring more than 3  500 people that the jury -- found had been exposed over many years -- with the companies ' knowledge -- to cancer-causing pcbs .,Democratic
there is little doubt in the anniston case that  had s. 5 been law  the defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state court that serves the community that suffered this devastating harm .,Democratic
even in the best-case scenario  s. 5 would put plaintiffs like those in anniston in the position of having to fight costly and time-consuming court battles in order to preserve their chosen forum for litigating their claims .,Democratic
in any case  it would reward the kind of reckless corporate misbehavior demonstrated by monsanto and solutia by giving defendants in such cases the right to remove state-law cases to federal court over the objections of those they have injured .,Democratic
the so-called `` class action fairness act '' would allow corporate polluters who harm the public 's health and welfare to exploit the availability of a federal forum whenever they perceive an advantage to doing so .,Democratic
it is nothing more than an attempt to take legitimate state-court claims by injured parties out of state court at the whim of those who have committed the injury .,Democratic
cases involving environmental harm and injury to the public from toxic exposure should not be subject to the bill 's provisions ; if these environmental harm cases are not excluded  we strongly urge you to vote against s. 5 .,Democratic

dear senate majority leader frist and senate minority leader reid : we  the undersigned state attorneys general  write to express our concern regarding one limited aspect of pending senate bill 5  the `` class action fairness act  '' or any similar legislation .,Democratic
we take no position on the act as a general matter and  indeed  there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act .,Democratic
we join together  however  in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor 's potential amendment to s. 5  or any similar legislation  clarifying that the act does not apply to  and would have no effect on  actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens .,Democratic
as attorneys general  we frequently investigate and bring actions against defendants who have caused harm to our citizens .,Democratic
these cases are usually brought pursuant to the attorney general 's parens patriae authority under our respective consumer protection and antitrust statutes .,Democratic
in some instances  such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state .,Democratic
it is our concern that certain provisions of s. 5 might be misinterpreted to hamper the ability of the attorneys general to bring such actions  thereby impeding one means of protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its resulting harm .,Democratic
the attorneys general have been very successful in litigation initiated to protect the rights of our consumers .,Democratic
for example  in the pharmaceutical industry  the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large  often foreign-owned  drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs .,Democratic
such cases have resulted in recoveries of approximately 235 million dollars  the majority of which is earmarked for consumer restitution .,Democratic
in several instances  the states ' recoveries provided one hundred percent reimbursement directly to individual consumers of the overcharges they suffered as a result of the illegal activities of the defendants .,Democratic
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets of those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices  senior citizens living on fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance .,Democratic
we encourage you to support the aforementioned amendment exempting all actions brought by state attorneys general from the provisions of s. 5  or any similar legislation .,Democratic
it is important to all of our constituents  but especially to the poor  elderly and disabled  that the provisions of the act not be misconstrued and that we maintain the enforcement authority needed to protect them from illegal practices .,Democratic
we respectfully submit that the overall purposes of the legislation would not be impaired by such an amendment that merely clarifies the existing authority of our respective states .,Democratic
thank you for your consideration of this very important matter .,Democratic
please contact any of us if you have questions or comments .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to seriously consider the excellent presentations made on our side of the aisle and vote against the measure that is before us today .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
once again  mr.,Democratic
speaker  we have before us a bill that would sweep aside generations of state laws that protect consumers .,Democratic
citizens will be denied their basic right to use their own state courts to file class action lawsuits against companies -- even if there are clear violations of state labor laws or state civil rights laws .,Democratic
this bill comes after a lobbying campaign costing business interests tens of millions of dollars .,Democratic
well  that was money well spent .,Democratic
with this sweeping legislation  corporations will have free reign to avoid responsibility for the wrongs they commit .,Democratic
it is just shameful that the victims of corporate misconduct do not have the same level of influence here in the halls of congress .,Democratic
let 's not forget the people who died as a result of defective tires manufactured by firestone .,Democratic
what about countless individuals who died as a result of the tobacco industry 's failure to disclose the risks of cigarettes ?,Democratic
well  if it is any indication of this bill 's intent -- tobacco is already celebrating this week .,Democratic
stocks are up and the industry is glowing .,Democratic
let me quote their take on this bill  `` the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are.,Democratic
'' plainly that is the goal of the bill .,Democratic
the goal is to ensure that legitimate plaintiffs are denied any recovery at all .,Democratic
and that whatever recovery they do receive is delayed as long as possible .,Democratic
i have spent decades in courtrooms and i can tell my colleagues -- from my own experience -- that justice delayed is justice denied .,Democratic
the doors to the courthouse will be locked shut .,Democratic
and this republican leadership is handing the key to corporate america .,Democratic
with complete disregard for precedent-setting individual and class action litigation  the republican leadership is determined to destroy america 's civil justice system  eliminating protections for the poor and powerless .,Democratic
this bill is a disgrace to the historic victories in courts across the country -- to expand consumer rights  protect our environment  and strengthen workers ' rights .,Democratic
and there has been complete disregard for the legislative process in the house .,Democratic
while we have had hearings and markups on class action legislation in the past  this bill is quite complex and very different than previous versions .,Democratic
the fact that the other chamber has already approved this matter in no way justifies a `` rush to judgment '' in the house  when so many important rights are at stake .,Democratic
class actions have addressed the looting of company after company by corporate insiders  whose brazen misconduct and self-dealing defrauded creditors and investors of billions of dollars  and stripped employees and retirees of their livelihood and life savings .,Democratic
yet if this bill becomes law  the victims of those practices will face new obstacles in their efforts to call those executives to task .,Democratic
this bill is not about protecting plaintiffs .,Democratic
it 's not about protecting the public .,Democratic
it 's about protecting large corporations whose conduct has been egregious .,Democratic
it 's about protecting the powerful at the expense of the powerless .,Democratic
and to prevent people from banding together as a class to challenge that power in the only way they can .,Democratic
we must also see this bill in its proper context .,Democratic
it is part of an ambitious and multi-pronged campaign by major corporations to evade their obligations to society .,Democratic
under the guise of `` deregulation '' we 're watching the wholesale dismantling of health and safety standards  environmental protections  and longstanding limits on concentration of ownership within the media and other key industries .,Democratic
today 's bill completes this picture .,Democratic
it takes aim at the civil justice system that exists to correct the wrongs that the government can not or will not address .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to oppose this blatant effort to muzzle the courts .,Democratic
this bill is but the latest in a series of assaults by those on the other side attacking the ability of individuals to seek relief from the courts .,Democratic
and it is also but the latest in a series of assaults on states ' rights to provide legal remedies for harm suffered by their citizens .,Democratic
we can not allow them to do it  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no .,Democratic
'',Democratic
mr. speaker  i heard an earlier speaker refer to class actions as a game .,Democratic
try telling that to the 9-year-old son of janet huggins  a 39-year-old healthy tennessee mother who took vioxx and died in september 2004 .,Democratic
tell her family that the effort to protect her family is a game .,Democratic
this is not a game .,Democratic
this is flesh and blood  the ability to protect your family when something happens to you that you did not have anything to do with .,Democratic
this bill is the vioxx protection bill .,Democratic
it is the wal-mart protection bill .,Democratic
it is the tyco protection bill .,Democratic
it is the enron protection bill .,Democratic
anyone in the state of washington who saw what enron did to us  stealing $ 1 billion  should not be voting for this bill  because this bill in many ways is the just say no bill to people who are injured by rapacious wrongdoers .,Democratic
in three ways it says `` just say no '' to consumers who were hurt by enron  because in the federal courts  if you happen to be in a plaintiff 's group of multiple states and the laws are a little different in the states  do you know what the federal courts do ?,Democratic
they throw out the class action .,Democratic
do you want to know why the chamber of commerce is spending $ 1 billion to lobby on what seems to be a procedural issue ?,Democratic
because they throw out class actions where there is any difference in states  meaning you will not be able to have a class action anywhere  anywhere  federal or state .,Democratic
why is this so important ?,Democratic
i liken this to right now you have two arms to protect americans  the state judicial system and the federal judicial system .,Democratic
this reduces by half the resources that are available to americans to get redress when enron steals from them or when vioxx kills them .,Democratic
on 9/11  did we respond to september 11 by taking out city police officers and only having the fbi ?,Democratic
on 9/11  did we respond by not having local fire departments and only having the coast guard or army fire department ?,Democratic
no .,Democratic
we recognized that in our system of federalism  americans deserve the full protection  not just half the protection .,Democratic
this cuts the available judicial resources in half .,Democratic
why is that important ?,Democratic
the second reason it just says no to injured americans is the federal courts can not handle these class actions .,Democratic
they do not have enough courts and judges .,Democratic
you go down and ask how long you will wait today to get into a federal court .,Democratic
then add about 4 or 5 years after this bill if this bill were to come into effect .,Democratic
you just say no because it takes the keys away from the courthouse .,Democratic
the third reason it just says no to good american citizens is it takes from the state attorneys general their ability to protect people .,Democratic
that is why the states attorneys general  republican and democrat alike  are adamantly opposed to this bill  because this bill takes cops off the beat ; attorneys generals whose job it is to protect us from what roosevelt called the `` malefactors of great wealth '' are off the beat .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we should reject this bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am always amazed to hear the remarks of my colleagues  and i welcome those remarks  because it is well-known that free and open debate lies at the very heart of the democratic process .,Democratic
but i wonder if we rephrased the terminology `` greedy lawyers '' and made the american people truly understand what the give and take of the judicial process is all about .,Democratic
i wonder  if we said the lawyers that represented the 9/11 families could be considered greedy lawyers  thousands who lost loved ones  and their engagement in seeking to have redress of their grievances done in a class-action manner  is that evidence of greedy lawyers ?,Democratic
or maybe the thalidomide families  babies who were born deformed in the 1950s and class actions were utilized  is that a signal of greedy lawyers ?,Democratic
frankly  mr.,Democratic
speaker  what we have here is a complete abuse of the democratic process .,Democratic
why do we not think about a situation where you are a college student enrolled in a world history class  you enter the first day and the professor says  welcome  it is now time to take the final exam .,Democratic
no discussion  no notes  no teaching  no nothing .,Democratic
this is what this rule represents .,Democratic
it is to walk on this floor and take the final exam .,Democratic
it is to close the door of the opportunity for the american people to go into the courthouse and to have a jury of their peers decide whether or not  as a collective class  they have been injured .,Democratic
if my friends would tell the truth  they would know that plaintiffs prevail in such a small percentage of times all over america that this is ridiculous and ludicrous legislation .,Democratic
they would also refer you to the cato institute in 1983 when they talked about attacking liberal legal opportunities  or liberal bills .,Democratic
they said  this is guerilla warfare .,Democratic
we are going after tort litigation  we are going after social security  we are going after medicare .,Democratic
guerilla warfare .,Democratic
the reason why this is guerilla warfare is because we have a process  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
these actions come to our committee  the committee on the judiciary and a number of other committees ; we have opportunity for amendment  give and take  hearings .,Democratic
this legislation has seen no light of day in any committee .,Democratic
it did not see the light of day on the senate side  no hearings  no markup ; it did not see the light of day on the house side  no hearings  no markup .,Democratic
so the american people are being fooled by the fact that they think we are doing business as the constitution would want us to do  that we are open to the rules of this house  that we understand that we must have the oversight of this house .,Democratic
and frankly  mr.,Democratic
speaker  shame on us  for we are shaming the process  and the american people should rightly be ashamed of this and of us .,Democratic
i ask my republicans  we know you have the overwhelming majority  you have the two-thirds  in essence  you have the bully pulpit  and you use it .,Democratic
but the bad thing about it is that you are using it to overwhelm the rules of this house .,Democratic
mr. speaker  you are literally ignoring the rules of the house .,Democratic
and some people would say to me  congresswoman jackson-lee  this is inside the ball game  inside the ballpark  inside the beltway .,Democratic
the american people are not interested in process .,Democratic
i believe they are .,Democratic
because the american people know about school boards and process  they know about the parent-teacher meetings and process  they know about their places of faith and process  and they know that process is to be respected .,Democratic
here in this house we are not respecting process .,Democratic
i argue that the one amendment that we have as the manager 's amendment should be the amendment that should be accepted  and that is the one that includes the idea of protecting civil rights and wage-and-hour carve-outs and prohibits those companies that have formulated their companies in another country  united states companies incorporated elsewhere  in order to be able to participate in this abusive process .,Democratic
let me read what the new york times said .,Democratic
`` instead of narrowly focusing on real abuses of the system  the measure that is before us today reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback of corporate accountability and people 's rights .,Democratic
the main impact of the bill  which has a sort of propagandistic title normally assigned to such laws as the class action fairness act will be to funnel nearly all major class-action lawsuits out of state courts and into all overburdened federal courts .,Democratic
that will inevitably make it harder for americans to pursue legitimate claims successfully against companies that violate state consumer  health  civil rights  and environmental protection laws.,Democratic
'' mr.,Democratic
and mrs.,Democratic
america  let me tell you something .,Democratic
when this legislation passes on the republican clock  i am going to tell you that the doors of the courthouse will be closed to you ; and if you have johnny jones  the country lawyer  trying to bring justice to rural america  johnny jones will have to take his small-time practice and mortgage his house to get into the federal court .,Democratic
and not only that  you might get there 50 years from the time that action occurs .,Democratic
this is the greatest abomination and insult to justice that i have ever seen .,Democratic
it is an outrage  and i ask my colleagues to vote down the rule  vote for the democratic substitute  and put this terrible bill where it needs to go  packing out of the door .,Democratic
mr. speaker  free and open debate lies at the heart of the democratic process .,Democratic
without it  true democracy will surely wither away to nothing .,Democratic
it is in this light that i rise to support h. res.,Democratic
96 -- only insofar as it allows consideration of the democratic substitute that was ruled in order by the committee on rules and offered by the distinguished ranking member of the judiciary committee  mr.,Democratic
conyers .,Democratic
we should have an open rule on this important issue  however .,Democratic
for real and honest debate to take place on such an important issue as defining diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts for class actions  we must have available an alternate option to s. 5  the legislation that is before the committee of the whole house .,Democratic
the democratic substitute creates that option .,Democratic
i congratulate the rules committee for their foresight in enabling this open debate .,Democratic
this bill  despite its name  is not fair to all complainants who come to the courts for relief .,Democratic
in addition  it fails to render accountability to parties who are in the best financial position .,Democratic
one issue that i planned to address by way of amendment was that of punishing fraudulent parties to class action proceedings by preventing them from removing the matter to federal court .,Democratic
i am a co-sponsor of the amendment in nature of a substitute that will be offered by my colleagues .,Democratic
with the provisions that it contains  requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction will not be watered down resulting in the removal of nearly all class actions to federal court .,Democratic
a wholesale stripping of jurisdiction from the state courts should not be supported by this body .,Democratic
therefore  it needs to be made more stringent as to all parties and it needs to contain provisions to protect all claimants and their right to bring suit .,Democratic
contained within the amendment in nature of a substitute is a section that i proposed in the context of the terrorist penalties enhancement act that was included in the bill passed into law .,Democratic
this section relates to holding `` benedict arnold corporations '' accountable for their terrorist acts .,Democratic
with respect to s. 5  the right to seek removal to federal courts will be precluded for benedict arnold corporations .,Democratic
the `` benedict arnold corporation '' refers to a company that  in bad faith  takes advantage of loopholes in our tax code to establish bank accounts or to ship jobs abroad for the main purpose of tax avoidance .,Democratic
a tax-exempt group that monitors corporate influence called `` citizen works '' has compiled a list of 25 fortune 500 corporations that have the most offshore tax-haven subsidiaries .,Democratic
the percentage of increase in the number of tax havens held by these corporations since 1997 ranges between 85.7 percent and 9  650 percent .,Democratic
this significant increase in the number of corporate tax havens is no coincidence when we look at the benefits that can be found in doing sham business transactions .,Democratic
some of these corporations are `` benedict arnolds '' because they have given up their american citizenship ; however  they still conduct a substantial amount of their business in the united states and enjoy tax deductions of domestic corporations .,Democratic
the provision in the substitute amendment will preclude these corporations from enjoying the benefit of removing state class actions to federal court .,Democratic
forcing these corporate entities to defend themselves in state courts will ensure that these class action claims will be fairly and fully litigated .,Democratic
i support the amendment in nature of a substitute .,Democratic
mr. speaker  it is interesting to hear the distinguished gentleman from georgia mention the committee on rules  and i respect the power of the committee on rules .,Democratic
the committee on rules is not a jurisdictional committee .,Democratic
this bill did not go through the committee process on the senate side or on the house side .,Democratic
i might also say when we talk about coupons and the amount of dollars that lawyers may receive  might i remind the body that we are talking about thousands upon thousands of plaintiffs in a class action who would never have their grievances addressed and the corporate culprit would have never been punished had it not been for this class action .,Democratic
so to manipulate it to suggest that it is abused is manipulation  just that .,Democratic
this did not go through the committee process .,Democratic
we are avoiding the committee process .,Democratic
therefore  we are stamping on democracy and this rule and this bill should be voted down enthusiastically .,Democratic
mr. speaker  that pig may have lipstick  but i can tell my colleagues that it is still pretty unattractive .,Democratic
it is interesting that my good friend from virginia keeps talking about coupons and this 30 cents .,Democratic
what he is not telling those of us who understand what class action settlements really mean is that in the settlement comes the punishment for not doing or the incentive to not violate the law again .,Democratic
in the settlement comes an injunction that argues or stops the culprit  the violator  from doing harm again .,Democratic
there is an action .,Democratic
class actions do not always generate into dollars to petitioners .,Democratic
if you have been done harm  you want that harm to stop immediately so someone else can not be harmed .,Democratic
and the class action lawsuit and the so-called millions of dollars to attorneys for attorneys fees does not take into account the preparation for that case  the depositions  the travel .,Democratic
so it looks as if there is a great bounty or a gift being given to lawyers who are working to ensure that the punitive entity  the entity that has caused thousands of employees to lose pensions from corporations  the entity such as mci and others who have thrown away their corporate responsibility to their employees and caused them to lose all their money  who violated corporate laws and had the violation of trust and made sure that they did the self-dealing  these class actions were to say `` and do that no more  '' and `` we will not allow you to do that anymore.,Democratic
'' for example  the particular amendment that is included in the conyers-nadler-jackson-lee substitute  which i rise enthusiastically to support  the tax traitor corporation which leaves america and incorporates somewhere else and depletes all of its savings accounts  or all of its accounts  so therefore if there is an action  if you are harmed  if you are hurt and you sue here in the united states  you look up in the court and you find out there is empty pockets .,Democratic
why ?,Democratic
because they have overcome the laws of this land .,Democratic
they have absconded and you have no way of seeking relief .,Democratic
the substitute includes the relief that is necessary to ensure that citizens and consumers are protected .,Democratic
there is a civil rights carveout  so that you have a right to address your grievances without the expenses of a federal court .,Democratic
there is a wage and hour carveout  so that you can file against a company in your local jurisdiction as a class action when you have been violated on the minimum wage .,Democratic
physical injuries  so that when your child is injured in a park because of a defective product you have the right to go into your state courts and seek relief .,Democratic
now  i want to share with those who feel that we are now opening the doors of opportunity with the federal courts .,Democratic
let me share this with you .,Democratic
this is why this is a bogus litigation or legislation that will not work .,Democratic
arizona has 159 state judges  only 13 federal courts .,Democratic
tell me the difference in being able to go into a court that has 159 judges versus those who have 13 .,Democratic
what about the state of south carolina  with 48 state judges and merely 10 federal judges ; or rhode island with 22 state judges and three federal judges ; new york with 593 state judges and a mere 52 federal courts ; louisiana  211 state judges and 22 federal courts ?,Democratic
frankly  there is a farce going on here .,Democratic
at the end of the 108th congress there were 35 judicial vacancies in the federal courts .,Democratic
there is no opportunity to go into the federal courts .,Democratic
they are overburdened and overworked .,Democratic
justice rehnquist said something very important .,Democratic
he said  `` i have criticized congress and the president for their propensity to enact more and more legislation which brings more and more cases into the federal court system .,Democratic
this criticism received virtually no public attention .,Democratic
if congress enacts and the president signs new laws  allowing more cases to be brought into the federal courts  just filling the vacancies will not be enough .,Democratic
we need additional judgeships.,Democratic
'' this is a farce  i am saddened to say  even with the compromise .,Democratic
we all want to see the judicial system work .,Democratic
i know my good friend from virginia has good intentions  but this responds to a noncrisis with no resources  no added courts to the federal bench  and the backlog of cases all over america simply slams the door to injured parties across this land .,Democratic
the substitute is fair .,Democratic
it allows you to go into the state courts that have a bounty of judges  allows you to be heard  and it allows those corporate offenders or those products that have offended and harmed and maybe killed  those defective automobiles  to be in the courthouse and to have their concerns heard .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to this bill  s. 5  the class action fairness act .,Democratic
unfortunately for the millions of aggrieved plaintiffs in america with legitimate claims  this body has brought yet another piece of legislation to the floor that threatens to close the doors of the court .,Democratic
this bill  despite its name  is not fair to all complainants who come to the courts for relief .,Democratic
in addition  it fails to render accountability to parties who are in the best financial position .,Democratic
one issue that i planned to address by way of amendment was that of punishing fraudulent parties to class action proceedings by preventing them from removing the matter to federal court .,Democratic

mr. speaker  s. 5 applies not only to class actions but to all tort cases .,Democratic
it is highly inefficient to overwhelm the federal courts with the massive number of state claims that will come their way .,Democratic
not only are the federal courts less sympathetic to this kind of litigation  the practical effect will be that many cases will never be heard .,Democratic
the barriers to gaining federal jurisdiction to have a case heard is much higher than in state courts by virtue of their creation .,Democratic
as a result  the federal courts will be quick to refuse class certification in complex litigation matters .,Democratic
state courts are better suited to adjudicate complex class actions .,Democratic
i oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to join me .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i ask my colleagues to vote for the substitute and defeat the underlying bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
linda t. snchez ) .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for his excellent work on this very important piece of legislation .,Democratic
i rise in opposition to this rule and i rise in opposition to the underlying legislation .,Democratic
in the 1960s  president kennedy used to say  `` ask not what your country can do for you  but what you can do for your country.,Democratic
'' today  republican leaders in washington have issued a new challenge : `` ask not what your country can do for you  but what you can do for the country club.,Democratic
'' that is what this bill is all about .,Democratic
it is protecting the country club members from the responsibility for the harm which they potentially inflict from their corporate perspectives on ordinary citizens within our society .,Democratic
the class-action bill is part of an overall strategy which the republican party has put in place in order to harm consumers all across our country  to repeal the protections that have been placed upon the books for two generations that ensure that the individual in our society is given the protection which they need .,Democratic
here is their strategy .,Democratic
it is a simple  four-part strategy .,Democratic
number one  first is the `` borrow and spend '' strategy .,Democratic
that is all part of this idea that paul o'neill mentioned  the former secretary of treasury for george bush  when he said that dick cheney said to him  `` reagan proved that deficits do n't matter.,Democratic
'' of course  the reason they do not matter is that  as grover norquist has pointed out quite clearly  the architect of this republican strategy  the key goal has to be to starve the beast ; the beast  of course  being the federal government 's ability to help ordinary people  to help ordinary citizens  to help ordinary consumers in our country when they are being harmed .,Democratic
so this idea that there is less and less money then starves the federal agencies given the responsibility for protecting the public  the federal drug administration  the consumer product safety commission ; agency after agency left with not enough resources to protect the consumer  which they were intended to do .,Democratic
secondly  there is the grim reaper of regulatory relief  where the office of management and budget inside of the bush administration ensures that any regulation that is meant to protect the consumer is tied up in endless rounds of peer review and cost-benefit analysis  weighing the lives of ordinary consumers against the money that corporations might have to spend in order to make sure that their products are not defective  that they do not harm ordinary citizens across our country .,Democratic
then there is stage three  the fox in the hen house .,Democratic
this is where the bush administration then appoints somebody from the industry that is meant to be regulated as the head of the agency  knowing that that individual has no likelihood of actually putting on the books the kinds of protections which are needed .,Democratic
then  finally  after the federal government is not capable of really protecting ordinary citizens  their safety  their health  then what they say to the citizen is  by the way  now we are going to make it almost impossible for you to go to court to protect yourself  to bring a case .,Democratic
that is what this bill is all about  that final step .,Democratic
you can not even as an individual partner with other people to go to court .,Democratic
and here is what it says .,Democratic
it says that all of these cases are going to federal court  unless a significant defendant is in fact a citizen of the state .,Democratic
well  think about this .,Democratic
let us go to new hampshire .,Democratic
new hampshire is a perfect example .,Democratic
new hampshire has a suit which it has brought against 22 oil and chemical companies because of the pollution in the state 's waterways with mtbe  a deadly  dangerous material which has harmed people all across our country  but new hampshire is the best example .,Democratic
under this new law  because the principal defendant in the case is amerada hess and because it is headquartered in new york and it is the principal defendant  not only amerada hess but the other 22 companies  not only is amerada hess  this big company  and the other 22 companies who have arrived in new hampshire  polluting the state  given the relief of not having the case be held in the state of new hampshire  with new hampshire judges and new hampshire citizens  instead it is removed to the federal court  so the republicans can name judges who they know are going to be sympathetic to the companies  not the state of new hampshire  not their judges  not their people .,Democratic
that is what this is all about .,Democratic
it is making sure that ordinary citizens in new hampshire  whose families have been harmed  whose health is permanently ruined  can not bring a case against large corporations .,Democratic
who gets the benefit of this ?,Democratic
the defendant .,Democratic
the defendant .,Democratic
they come in from out-of-state  they pollute  they harm  they ruin the lives of people  and then the defendant says  `` i do n't want to be tried in new hampshire .,Democratic
i do n't want to be tried in texas .,Democratic
i do n't want to be tried in that state .,Democratic
i want to go some other place.,Democratic
'' what about the plaintiffs ?,Democratic
what about the people who have been harmed ?,Democratic
what about the mothers ?,Democratic
what about the children ?,Democratic
what about the people who have lost their health ?,Democratic
this is the final nail that the republicans are putting in the coffin of the rights of ordinary citizens to be able to protect themselves .,Democratic
all of these cases should be brought in the state courts where the large corporation caused the harm  not in a federal court away from the closest people who know what is right and wrong inside of that state .,Democratic
mr. speaker  vote no on this critical bill .,Democratic
vote no on the rule .,Democratic
vote to protect the consumers  the families  the children  the seniors in our country who the republicans are going to allow to be jeopardized by moving the cases from where they live to places where the defendants  the largest corporations  will be able to protect their own selfish self-interests .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding  and i thank him for his leadership on this most critical of all consumer issues before congress this year .,Democratic
so you have all heard now the technical arguments made by the bush administration proponents here on the house floor .,Democratic
so you have heard the bush administration argument on why this is good .,Democratic
now  you want to hear what the bill is really about ?,Democratic
do you want to hear what the bush administration is really interested in ?,Democratic
well  here it is  ladies and gentlemen .,Democratic
citigroup 's smith barney subdivision : `` tobacco .,Democratic
flash -- senate just passed class action bill -- positive for tobacco.,Democratic
'' let me read it to you : `` the senate just passed a bill  72-26.,Democratic
'' this has gone out from smith barney to all their investors .,Democratic
`` this bill is designated to funnel class action suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system  which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation .,Democratic
`` the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are  which might help limit the number of cases.,Democratic
'' smith barney advised its clients that this bill will be positive in general for the tobacco industry and that tobacco stocks have rallied on this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact on tobacco litigation .,Democratic
that is what it is all about  ladies and gentlemen .,Democratic
you heard the technical defense of it for the last half hour .,Democratic
the impact is they are trying to protect the tobacco industry from being sued .,Democratic
so if you are out there  one of your family members has just found that they have a spot on their lung  they have smoked for the last 20 or 30 years  what this bill will do is it will make it more difficult for you and the other people in your states who also have found that they have spots on their lungs to get together to sue the tobacco companies .,Democratic
if your children are beginning to smoke  they are 13  14  15  this bill is intended to make it more difficult for the people in the state of new hampshire  or kansas  or oklahoma to bring a suit to stop it .,Democratic
that is what it is all about .,Democratic
smith barney gives the good news to the tobacco industry investors  not to smokers .,Democratic
and so what they have done is this .,Democratic
it is brilliant in the bush administration and that is what this side of the aisle is all about .,Democratic
the fda  is it going to move in to regulate tobacco ?,Democratic
no  they made sure they appoint people who will not do it .,Democratic
the epa  are they going to move in to make sure that the oil industry does not pollute your groundwater so that the children in your neighborhood do not contract leukemia ; that breast cancers do not rise ?,Democratic
no .,Democratic
are they going to have a department of labor which protects you against asbestos in the workplace ?,Democratic
no .,Democratic
you are not going to see those suits  ladies and gentlemen .,Democratic
so it comes to you and your families to go to court .,Democratic
and what this bill is intended to do is to not let you go to court .,Democratic
so it is perfect .,Democratic
if you are an asbestos company  your stocks are going up .,Democratic
if you are a tobacco company  your stocks are going up .,Democratic
if you are an oil company  a chemical company  your stocks are going up .,Democratic
smith barney gives you the good news  mr.,Democratic
and mrs.,Democratic
investor of america .,Democratic
but if you are afraid for the health of your family  if you know that the groundwater in new hampshire has been poisoned by amerada hess and 22 other oil companies that are not in new hampshire  you know what the republicans say ?,Democratic
you know what the bush administration says ?,Democratic
the case should not be held in new hampshire .,Democratic
if amerada hess  the big oil company  is a defendant  the case should be outside of new hampshire  not protecting the person whose family 's health has been injured .,Democratic
and so that is what it is all about .,Democratic
it is the final payback to the tobacco industry  to the asbestos industry  to the oil industry  to the chemical industry at the expense of ordinary families who need to be able to go to court to protect their loved ones when their health has been compromised .,Democratic
and these people are saying  your state is not smart enough  your jurors are not smart enough to understand how the mtbe ruined the groundwater in their state and poisoned thousands of people  that it has to go to a state where amerada hess or some large oil company feels comfortable  because they are not headquartered in new hampshire  they do not have a large plant in new hampshire .,Democratic
all they did was sell the material which poisoned your neighborhood .,Democratic
that is what it is all about  ladies and gentlemen .,Democratic
you just watch across the board every single interest that harms the health and well-being of america skyrocket as soon as we take the vote on final passage of this bill today because president bush is going to sign this bill with great joy because the oil  the chemical and polluting industries are going to be happy .,Democratic
industry note : tobacco -- senate just passed class action bill -- positive for tobacco the senate just passed a bill 72-26 which is designed to funnel class-action suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system  which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation .,Democratic
the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are  which might help limit the number of cases .,Democratic
although this news is positive in general for the tobacco industry  we do not necessarily believe that class actions pose a big threat to the industry .,Democratic
furthermore  this type of legislation would have been a bigger help to the industry if it was passed 10 years ago .,Democratic
the bill now moves to the house floor and the chances are high that it passes since the house republican leadership said last week that it would pass the senate 's version of this legislation as long as there were no amendments .,Democratic
the senate just passed a bill that is designed to funnel class-action lawsuits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system  which is historically much less sympathetic to such litigation .,Democratic
the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard  which might also be positive for tobacco companies .,Democratic
federal judges  facing overburdened dockets and ambiguities about applying state laws in a federal court  often refuse to grant standing to class-action plaintiffs .,Democratic
therefore  tobacco stocks have rallied on this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact on potential future tobacco litigation .,Democratic
now the bill should move to the house floor and apparently the house republican leadership announced last week that the gop majority in that chamber will pass the senate 's version of class-action litigation provided it arrives without amendments and from what we hear  this is in fact what has happened in the senate .,Democratic
obviously president bush has been a big proponent of this type of legislation so we would assume that he would sign it as part of a broader fight that he hopes will lead to limits on awards in asbestos cases and to caps on pain-and-suffering awards in medical malpractice cases .,Democratic
although positive in general terms for the tobacco companies  clearly this type of legislation would have been much more useful if it were passed 10 years ago .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume  and i thank the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Democratic
gingrey ) xz4001510 for yielding me the customary 30 minutes .,Democratic
mr. speaker  for years the republican majority proposed so-called `` reforms '' to class action lawsuits .,Democratic
time after time  the house would pass legislation limiting class action plaintiffs only to see their attempts to dismantle the class action system die either with senate inaction or in conference .,Democratic
mr. speaker  it looks as though the republican leadership has finally gamed the system to the point where it appears that they will succeed in severely limiting the rights of many of the most vulnerable citizens in this country .,Democratic
dismantling the class action lawsuit system has long been a big priority for big business groups .,Democratic
last year  for instance  the chamber spent $ 50 million in lobbying .,Democratic
now they are getting what they paid for  because this bill obliterating the class action system is one of the first bills to be considered in this congress .,Democratic
mr. speaker  it is clear to me that despite the mccain-feingold campaign finance reform law  we still have a pay-to-play system .,Democratic
the other body considered this bill first .,Democratic
the plan was that the house take up the senate bill if the other body could pass a clean bill without any amendments .,Democratic
the senate succeeded in passing a bad bill and the house is now following suit .,Democratic
let me be clear .,Democratic
despite the rhetoric on the other side  this is still a bad bill .,Democratic
today  the other side will tell scary stories about greedy trial lawyers and how awful and unfair their practices are  but the republican leadership will not talk about how this bill limits the rights of low-wage workers to seek justice from employers who have cheated them out of their wages or have discriminated against them .,Democratic
they will not talk about how they are limiting workers ' rights and  with the passage of this bill  are encouraging the bad apples in the big business community to continue cheating their employees out of their hard-earned wages and rights .,Democratic
in most cases  state laws provide greater civil rights protections than federal law .,Democratic
every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability .,Democratic
some states have laws that go beyond the federal americans with disabilities act .,Democratic
the same is true with age discrimination .,Democratic
there are also states that provide protections that are not covered by federal law .,Democratic
these federal laws are intended to be floors  not ceilings .,Democratic
we should commend states that extend further rights to their citizens  not punish them .,Democratic
this bill federalizes class action and mass torts  moving these cases from state to federal courts .,Democratic
if the bill is signed into law  hard-working americans will be denied the right to use their own state courts to bring class actions against corporations that violate laws that are unique to their state .,Democratic
consider  for example  a class action lawsuit brought against a national corporation by employees of a store in massachusetts because that store discriminates on the basis of ancestry  place of birth  or citizenship status .,Democratic
massachusetts provides protections afforded by state law  but not by federal law .,Democratic
under this bill  except in very rare instances  that case would be sent to a federal court instead of state court  even though the case is based on a violation of state law .,Democratic
a class action lawsuit against wal-mart was recently filed in massachusetts .,Democratic
the suit alleges that wal-mart failed to pay employees for the time worked and did not give them proper meal and rest breaks .,Democratic
these are serious charges .,Democratic
if the class action fairness act is signed into law  future cases like this would not be tried in massachusetts court  but instead would be transferred to federal court .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we know that the federal courts are already over burdened  but we also know that the federal courts are less likely to certify classes or provide relief for violations of state law .,Democratic
in effect  this bill is rigging the system on behalf of the corporations and against the interests of workers .,Democratic
we often hear a lot of lofty rhetoric on the other side about states rights .,Democratic
apparently the other side only supports the rights of states if they agree with the laws of those states .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this bill is opposed by the leadership conference of civil rights ; the alliance for justice ; the national conference of state legislatures ; 14 state attorneys general ; afscme ; and environmental groups like friends of the earth  greenpeace  the sierra club  and the national environmental trust .,Democratic
these are just a few of the groups who oppose this bill  and none of them represent the trial lawyers .,Democratic
they oppose this bill because it will limit fairness  it will limit justice  and it will ultimately hurt everyday americans .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this is not about trial lawyers ; it is about average citizens .,Democratic
the opponents of this bill are committed to fairness .,Democratic
we are committed to justice .,Democratic
and this bill robs the american people of their rights to fairness and justice in the judicial system .,Democratic
it closes the courthouse door in the face of people who need and deserve help .,Democratic
i oppose this bill  and i urge my colleagues to support the conyers substitute .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  my colleague from georgia had kind of quoted from a study implying that most of these class-action cases would remain in states  that the whole purpose of this bill is to try to move them to federal courts .,Democratic
let me quote from a cbo cost estimate which says that under this bill  most class-action lawsuits would be heard in federal district court  rather than in the state court .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990  a member of the committee on the judiciary and a ranking subcommittee member .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Democratic
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for the time that he has spent on this legislation .,Democratic
i think we have seen this come across our desks for a number of sessions  and we have tried to work in a bipartisan manner in order to find a way to respond to some of the larger class actions that are now proceeding before us in the courts .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me start out by trying to address some of the large dilemmas that have seemingly been the underpinnings of this overhaul of a system that is not broken .,Democratic
i know some two or three sessions ago we were in the midst of conversations about the asbestos lawsuits .,Democratic
frankly  i believe that with a reasonable dialogue and exchange  we were nearing some sort of resolution that would have allowed that heinous series of events over the years  the asbestos poisoning for many  many workers  to be brought to a conclusion .,Democratic
for some reason  those favoring class action reform want to paint with a broad brush the victims  those who have been victimized by asbestos poisoning .,Democratic
even today as we are looking to reconstruct some of the older buildings in my community  we are finding an asbestos problem .,Democratic
but because of the notice that was given through these class action lawsuits  we now have companies who are protecting workers who are going in trying to clean out asbestos .,Democratic
we would not have had that had we had not had this asbestos crisis .,Democratic
it is the same thing with tobacco .,Democratic
although there has been some humor about `` do n't you know when to stop smoking  '' we know that for years and years  years and years  there was no labeling of cigarettes to suggest that they in fact caused cancer .,Democratic
so the tobacco lawsuits are not in fact frivolous .,Democratic
they may be high in return  but they are not frivolous .,Democratic
this class action lawsuit legislation  i believe  is excessive and overreaching .,Democratic
what it simply wants to do is burden federal courts without giving them any resources .,Democratic
there is nothing in this legislation that increases the funding of our federal courts .,Democratic
take the southern district  for example .,Democratic
we are so overburdened with criminal cases  immigration cases  smuggling cases  drug cases  there is absolutely no room to orderly now prosecute or allow to proceed class action lawsuits from people who have been damaged enormously .,Democratic
this legislation wants to federalize mass torts  that is thousands and thousands of people  when they realize that the compromise  for example  that was offered in the senate  the feinstein compromise  does not do anything  because what it says is you can go into state court if you can find one of the defendants of a large corporation in your state .,Democratic
if you happen to be a small state or maybe some state that is not the headquarters of corporate entities  like on the east coast  for example  you will find no defendant  so you will be languishing year after year after year trying to get into federal court .,Democratic
what it also does is minimizes the opportunity of those who can secure their local lawyer to get them into a state court and burdens them with the responsibility of finding some high-priced counsel that they can not afford to try to understand federal procedure law to get into the federal court .,Democratic
it closes the door to the least empowered : the poor  the working class and the middle class .,Democratic
what we find as well is that this legislation is much broader than is needed .,Democratic
why close the door to those who are injured by the failings of products ?,Democratic
why close the doors to those who are injured by the mass and unfortunate activities of a company like enron in my congressional district  penalizing thousands of workers all over america unfairly and giving them no relief  giving no relief to the pensioners who lost all of their dollars ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  what we have here is a response to no crisis  a response to no problem .,Democratic
frankly  i believe that if we reasonably look at this legislation  we will find that all it does is it zippers the courthouse door .,Democratic
to my good friend who mentioned that civil rights can take place wherever is necessary  let me just share with you that civil rights is not a popular cause ; and  therefore  to then add it to get in line now with thousands of other cases  you can be assured that there will be a crisis .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me simply say i rise to support the substitute that has the civil rights carve-out  the wage-and-hour carve-out .,Democratic
it excludes non-action cases involving physical injuries  an attorney general carve-out  the anti-secrecy language ; and in particular it does not allow companies to go offshore to avoid class action lawsuits .,Democratic
mr. speaker  let me simply say this is a bill on the floor with no problem .,Democratic
but i can tell you  america  you are going to have a big problem once this bill is passed  and i am saddened by the fact that time after time we come to this floor and we close out the working people  we close out the middle-class  and we close out those who need relief .,Democratic
mr. speaker  under provisions of this bill  is it not the case that all future vioxx cases are prohibited ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
let me close by saying  this bill is not about lawyers .,Democratic
it is about people  and it is about state governments and attorney generals being able to pass laws in their own states to better protect their people .,Democratic
and it is ironic and it is almost kind of laughable that the majority  which has made it a point to argue on behalf of states right  is basically turning its back on what states have done to protect their people .,Democratic
the previous speaker talked about making sure that the plaintiffs got what they deserved .,Democratic
well  we are concerned about making sure that the plaintiffs get their day in court .,Democratic
and under this bill it makes it more difficult  especially for low-wage workers  for people who are battling discrimination to be able to have their day in court .,Democratic
the system clearly can be improved .,Democratic
nobody is arguing that .,Democratic
what i am saying here is that the bill before us does not provide the justice and the fairness that i think is appropriate .,Democratic
so i would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill .,Democratic
of state legislatures  february 2  2005 .,Democratic
dear senator : on behalf of the national conference of state legislatures ( ncsl )  i am urging you to oppose passage of s. 5  the `` class action fairness act of 2005.,Democratic
'' this legislation will federalize class actions involving only state law claims .,Democratic
s. 5 undermines our system of federalism  disrespects our state court system  and clearly preempts carefully crafted state judicial processes which have been in place for decades regarding the treatment of class action lawsuits .,Democratic
the overall tenor of s. 5 sends a disturbing message to the american people that state court systems are somehow inferior or untrustworthy .,Democratic
s. 5 amends the federal rules of civil procedure to grant federal district courts original diversity jurisdiction over any class action lawsuit where the amount in controversy exceeds $ 5  000  000 or where any plaintiff is a citizen of a different state than any defendant  or in other words  any class action lawsuit .,Democratic
the effect of s. 5 on state legislatures is that state laws in the areas of consumer protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or illegal activities will almost never be heard in state courts .,Democratic
ironically  state courts  whose sole purpose is to interpret state laws  will be bypassed and the federal judiciary will be asked to render judgment in these cases .,Democratic
the impact of s. 5 is that state processes will be preempted by federal ones which are n't necessarily better .,Democratic
ncsl opposes the passage of federal legislation  such as s. 5 which preempts established state authority .,Democratic
state courts have traditionally and correcdy been the repository for most class action lawsuits because state laws  not federal ones  are at issue .,Democratic
congress should proceed cautiously before permitting the federal government to interfere with the authority of states to set their own laws and procedures in their own courts .,Democratic
ncsl urges congress to remember that state policy choices should not be overridden without a showing of compelling national need .,Democratic
we should await evidence demonstrating that states have broadly overreached or are unable to address the problems themselves .,Democratic
there must be evidence of harm to interests of national scope that require a federal response  and even with such evidence  federal preemption should be limited to remedying specific problems with tailored solutions  something that s. 5 does not do .,Democratic
i urge you to oppose this legislation .,Democratic
please contact susan parnas frederickat the national conference of statelegislatures at 202-624-3566 or susan,Democratic
frederick @ ncsl.org for further information .,Democratic
sincerely  new york state senator ; and chair  february 7  2005 .,Democratic
dear senator : our organizations are opposed to the sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named `` class action fairness act of 2005.,Democratic
'' this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills  contaminated drinking water  polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws .,Democratic
s. 5 would allow corporate defendants in many pollution class actions and `` mass tort '' environmental cases to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from state court to federal court  placing the cases in a forum that could be more costly  more time-consuming  and disadvantageous to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution .,Democratic
state law environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the class action bill .,Democratic
class actions protect the public 's health and the environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication of their cases .,Democratic
all too often  hazardous spills  water pollution  or other toxic contamination from a single source affects large numbers of people  not all of whom may be citizens or residents of the same state as that of the defendants who caused the harm .,Democratic
in such cases  a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence  nuisance or trespass  or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur  is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims .,Democratic
for example  thousands of families around the country are now suffering because of widespread groundwater contamination caused by the gasoline additive mtbe  which the u.s. government considers a potential human carcinogen .,Democratic
according to a may  2002 gao report  35 states reported that they find mtbe in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they sample for it  and 24 states said that they find it at least 60 percent of the time .,Democratic
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable  but under this bill  mtbe class actions or `` mass actions '' based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases .,Democratic
this could not only make these cases more expensive  more time-consuming and more difficult for injured parties  but could also result in the dismissal of legitimate cases by federal judges who are unfamiliar with  or less respectful of  state-law claims .,Democratic
for example  in at least one mtbe class action  a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies ' claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act ( even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe ) .,Democratic
yet a california state court rejected a similar federal preemption argument and let the case go to a jury  which found oil refineries  fuel distributors  and others liable for damages .,Democratic
these cases highlight how a state court may be more willing to uphold legitimate state law claims .,Democratic
other examples of state-law in a letter to the senate last year  the u.s. judicial conference expressed their continued opposition to such broadly written class action removal legislation .,Democratic
notably  their letter states that  even if congress determines that some `` significant multi-state class actions '' should be brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal courts  congress should include certain limitations and exceptions  including for class actions `` in which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or personal property damage within the state  as in the case of a serious environmental disaster.,Democratic
'' the judicial conference 's letter explains that this `` environmental harm '' exception should apply `` to all individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property  whether or not they were citizens of the state in question.,Democratic
'' we agree with the judicial conference that cases involving environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases that proponents of s. 5 cite when they call for reforms to the class action system .,Democratic
including such cases in the bill penalizes injured parties in those cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters .,Democratic
no rationale has been offered by the bill 's supporters for including environmental cases in s. 5 's provisions .,Democratic
we are unaware of any examples offered by bill supporters of environmental harm cases that represent alleged abuses of the state class actions .,Democratic
more proof of the overreaching of this bill is that the so-called `` class action fairness act '' is not even limited to class action cases .,Democratic
the bill contains a provision that would allow defendants to remove to federal court all environmental `` mass action '' cases involving more than 100 people -- even though these cases are not even filed as class actions .,Democratic
for example  the bill would apply to cases similar to the recently concluded state-court trial in anniston  alabama  where a jury awarded damages to be paid by monsanto and solutia for injuring more than 3  500 people that the jury found had been exposed over many years -- with the companies ' knowledge -- to cancer-causing pcbs .,Democratic
there is little doubt in the anniston case that  had s. 5 been law  the defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state court that serves the community that suffered this devastating harm .,Democratic
even in the best-case scenario  s. 5 would put plaintiffs like those in anniston in the position of having to fight costly and time-consuming court battles in order to preserve their chosen forum for litigating their claims .,Democratic
in any case  it would reward the kind of reckless corporate misbehavior demonstrated by monsanto and solutia by giving defendants in such cases the right to remove state-law cases to federal court over the objections of those they have injured .,Democratic
the so-called `` class action fairness act '' would allow corporate polluters who harm the public 's health and welfare to exploit the availability of a federal forum whenever they perceive an advantage to doing so .,Democratic
it is nothing more than an attempt to take legitimate state-court claims by injured parties out of state court at the whim of those who have committed the injury .,Democratic
cases involving environmental harm and injury to the public from toxic exposure should not be subject to the bill 's provisions ; if these environmental harm cases are not excluded  we strongly urge you to vote against s. 5 .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to s. 5  the so-called class action fairness act .,Democratic
few of us would stand here and argue that there is too much accountability in corporate america today .,Democratic
in recent years  millions of our constituents have been swindled out of their retirement savings by corporate crooks at enron  worldcom  and other companies .,Democratic
for years  many unscrupulous mutual fund managers were skimming off the top of their clients ' investment funds .,Democratic
drug companies put new products on the market like vioxx that they knew to be unsafe .,Democratic
this bill is a windfall for companies that have profited while causing harm to others .,Democratic
and no industry is in a better position to benefit than the tobacco industry .,Democratic
it 's little wonder that tobacco stocks rallied at the news that the senate had passed this bill .,Democratic
i 'd like to read from a wall street analyst 's view of how this bill would impact the tobacco industry .,Democratic
`` flash -- senate just passed class action bill -- positive for tobacco  '' the analyst writes .,Democratic
`` the senate just passed a bill 72-26 which is designed to funnel class-action suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system  which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation .,Democratic
the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are  which might help limit the number of cases.,Democratic
'' i only wish that the proponents of this bill would use such candid language to describe its true intent -- to make sure that legitimate cases are never heard  and to shield corporations from accountability for their actions .,Democratic
the class action system is a major reason why we have safer consumer products  more honest advertising  cleaner air and drinking water  and better workplace protections than many other countries .,Democratic
all of us are empowered by the right to band together and seek justice .,Democratic
class actions are one of the most effective and powerful ways we have to hold people accountable for their actions .,Democratic
i oppose this attempt to shut the courthouse door to people who have been wronged .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time  even though i am in opposition to his position and favor this bill .,Democratic
this is not a radical bill  nor is it regressive .,Democratic
in fact  it is a reasonable compromise designed to address what is an abuse of the judicial system .,Democratic
that is why the washington post endorses this bill .,Democratic
it is why the democratic senators from new york  california  and illinois all voted for the bill .,Democratic
in fact  democratic senators representing 19 states voted for this bill in the other body .,Democratic
why did they do this ?,Democratic
because they believe on balance that consumers are going to be better represented in federal courts .,Democratic
and this notion that somehow state courts are going to be more inclined to represent consumer interests rather than federal courts on issues like tobacco and civil rights and so on  i do not think history proves that to be the case .,Democratic
i am particularly sensitive to these charges that this bill is going to inhibit civil rights actions .,Democratic
clearly if we look at history  it is the federal courts that have been far more insistent upon enforcement of civil rights than state courts .,Democratic
even recently in the home depot case  a gender-discrimination case  it was settled with a $ 65 million settlement  filed in federal court .,Democratic
the coca-cola racial-discrimination settlement  which guaranteed each class member recovery of at least $ 38  000  was achieved in federal court .,Democratic
contrast that to the bank of boston case  where the depositors in boston were not even aware they were members of a plaintiff class  where a lawyer filed suit down in alabama supposedly representing their interest  and they found out when they had their bank account reduced by $ 90 ; $ 90 was taken out of the mortgage escrow account from these depositors to pay the lawyers when they were not even aware they were a member of the plaintiff 's suit  and the lawyer walks off with $ 8.25 million .,Democratic
that is judicial abuse  and that is what this bill corrects .,Democratic
this is a reasonable bill .,Democratic
the fact is that in so many state and local courts  they do not have the resources to go through the mountains of evidence that have to be presented in class action suits .,Democratic
in federal courts they are far more likely to have those resources .,Democratic
they have court clerks and they can hire magistrates that can go through all of the evidence .,Democratic
there has been far too much abuse where judges have certified these settlements at the tort lawyer 's request and then  the defendant has to settle for large sums of money .,Democratic
that is not the way it is supposed to work .,Democratic
on balance  i think the judicial system will be far more fair  responsible  and reasonable under this compromise bill ; so i would urge my colleagues  particularly on the democratic side  to support this bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the class action fairness act could not be more inappropriately named  and this motion to commit shows why .,Democratic
since 1999  merck has spent over $ 100 million a year to advertise vioxx .,Democratic
more than 80 million people took vioxx  and the drug generated sales of $ 2.5 billion for merck .,Democratic
merck should take responsibility for the harm their products may cause .,Democratic
thousands  literally thousands of american families believe they lost a loved one or suffered personal harm because vioxx was unsafe .,Democratic
these families believe merck knew of the danger vioxx was causing  but allowed the drug to remain on the market anyway .,Democratic
maybe they are right .,Democratic
maybe they are not .,Democratic
but the point is that the so-called class action fairness act does not give them a fair chance to make their case before a jury of their peers .,Democratic
the class action fairness act makes it very difficult for those who feel they were harmed by drugs like vioxx from getting the justice they deserve .,Democratic
we should adopt this motion to commit and pass a class action fairness act worthy of the name .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i would like to read a couple of cases here .,Democratic
mrs.,Democratic
higgins xz4006410 of tennessee was a 39-year-old woman who died of a sudden heart attack after taking vioxx .,Democratic
she was the mother of a 9-year-old son .,Democratic
when she was diagnosed with the early onset of rheumatoid arthritis  vioxx was prescribed .,Democratic
she had no former cardiac problems or family history .,Democratic
according to her medical records  mrs.,Democratic
higgins xz4006410 was in otherwise excellent health ; but on september 25  2004  she died of a sudden heart attack  less than a month after she started taking vioxx .,Democratic
she was buried on the very day in september that merck took vioxx off the market .,Democratic
on october 28  2004  her husband  monty  filed a claim against merck in the superior court of new jersey  atlantic city division .,Democratic
why new jersey ?,Democratic
this couple is from tennessee .,Democratic
because that is the state where merck is headquartered .,Democratic
in an interview on `` 60 minutes  '' mr.,Democratic
higgins xz4006410 said  `` i believe my wife would be here if merck had decided to take vioxx off the market just 1 month earlier.,Democratic
'' then there is richard `` dickie '' irvin of florida who was a 53-year-old former football coach and president of the athletic booster association .,Democratic
he had received his college football scholarship and was inducted into the school 's football hall of fame .,Democratic
he went on to play in canadian league football until suffering a career-ending injury .,Democratic
in addition to coaching  he worked at a family-owned seafood shop where he was constantly moving crates of seafood .,Democratic
he rarely went to see a doctor and had no major medical problems .,Democratic
in april of 2001  mr.,Democratic
irvin was prescribed vioxx for his football knee injury from years ago .,Democratic
approximately 23 days after he began taking vioxx  mr.,Democratic
irvin died from a sudden  unexpected heart attack .,Democratic
an autopsy revealed that his heart attack was caused by a sudden blood clot .,Democratic
this is the exact type of injury that has been associated with vioxx use .,Democratic
mr. irvin and his wife of 31 years had four children and three grandchildren .,Democratic
i could read more cases involving vioxx  but most people in this house  mr.,Democratic
speaker  probably agree with me that merck should be held accountable if they knew about the harmful effects of vioxx .,Democratic
the class action section of this bill  however  would allow merck and other corporate defendants to delay their day of reckoning for years and years and years ; and justice for these individuals ' families would be delayed ; and justice delayed is justice denied .,Democratic
again  this bill should be defeated .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to s. 5 .,Democratic
the sponsors of this bill call it the class action fairness act  but nothing about this bill is fair  especially for the victims of corporate wrongdoing .,Democratic
this bill erects a nearly insurmountable barrier for everyday americans  who have been hurt or wronged  to have their day in court .,Democratic
thanks to the so-called class action fairness act  people who have had their civil rights trampled on will no longer be able to bring their claims to state court .,Democratic
it does not matter if the laws of their home state provide better civil rights protections or that it may be more convenient for the victims of discrimination to seek justice in a court where they live .,Democratic
with s. 5 they must go to federal court .,Democratic
the same burden is put on the backs of hourly wage workers who sue for back pay that they are owed .,Democratic
these folks are struggling to put food on their family 's table  and they almost certainly can not afford the high cost of multistate litigation .,Democratic
with s. 5 they  too  must bring their claims to a federal court that may not even be in their state just so that they can get the back pay that they do .,Democratic
i ask all the proponents of this bill  is that their idea of fairness ?,Democratic
let us be real .,Democratic
s. 5 is not about reducing venue shopping .,Democratic
it is not about the mythical scourge of predatory plaintiffs ' lawyers  and it is not about the fabricated economic drain of excessive jury awards .,Democratic
what this bill really is about is doing a favor for unscrupulous  negligent corporations by making it harder for their victims to sue them .,Democratic
it is protecting big businesses who are guilty of wrongdoing from liability .,Democratic
i am a lawyer and i acknowledge that there are some members of my profession who file frivolous suits .,Democratic
but if the lawyers are the ones that they claim are ruining this legal system  why are the sponsors of this bill making it harder for the victims ?,Democratic
this bill makes about as much sense as locking the door of a hospital in order to lower health care costs .,Democratic
kicking people out of the system does not solve the problem  and that is exactly what s. 5 does .,Democratic
it penalizes the victims of wrongdoing without doing anything to improve our legal system  and it shields bad actors from having to face the consequences of their action .,Democratic
where is the personal responsibility ?,Democratic
that is why i oppose this bill .,Democratic
i urge all of my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the final passage and to vote `` yes '' on the conyers substitute .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time .,Democratic
i rise in strong opposition to this egregious legislation and in support of the conyers/nadler/jackson-lee substitute amendment .,Democratic
this substitute amendment amends this bill in several ways to ensure that consumers  workers and victims in personal injury cases are not precluded from having a fair opportunity to present their cases in court .,Democratic
i know the distinguished minority leader and others have mentioned some of these instances .,Democratic
my good friend eliot spitzer  the distinguished attorney general of new york state  has joined 46 state attorneys general in expressing their concern that this legislation could limit their power to investigate and bring actions in their state courts against defendants who have caused harm to their citizen .,Democratic
our amendment clarifies that cases brought by states attorneys general will not be subject to the provision of this bill and would not be forced into federal court .,Democratic
the substitute also includes a provision which i have advocated for many years  which actually was supported by the distinguished chairman and passed the committee on the judiciary a couple of times  to limit the ability of corporations settling lawsuits to demand that records that may indicate threats to public health and safety be sealed  unless it is necessary to protect trade confidentiality .,Democratic
the substitute provides that when such a gag order is requested  and it is normally requested by both the plaintiff and the defendant because in the settlement the defendant insists on this as a condition of the settlement  the court then rubber stamps it .,Democratic
this substitute provides that if such a gag order is requested  the court must make a finding as to whether the defendant 's interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in knowing of the threat to its health or safety .,Democratic
if the court finds that the privacy interest outweighs the public interest  the court will issue the gag order .,Democratic
if the court finds the public interest in health and safety outweighs the privacy interest claimed in the specific case  the court must prohibit the sealing of the information .,Democratic
too often  critical information is sealed from the public and people are harmed as a result .,Democratic
how many people were killed or injured because the court sealed records relating to exploding firestone tires  for one example .,Democratic
this provision will allow the public to learn of threats to this health and safety so as to take proper action to protect the public  while protecting legitimate confidential information .,Democratic
the conyers/nadler/jackson-lee substitute amendment also deals with a major catch-22 created by the bill for victims of large and complex multistate court torts .,Democratic
on the one hand  the bill provides state courts can not hear such cases ; but when these cases are removed to federal court  plaintiffs will find that the federal courts routinely refuse to hear them .,Democratic
federal courts are very reluctant to certify a multistate consumer class action suit  and six circuit courts and 26 district courts have expressly refused to consider certifying cases where several state laws apply .,Democratic
our substitute protects victims from facing this catch-22 and having the courtroom door completely closed to them by providing that if these cases are removed to federal court by this bill  the federal courts can not refuse to certify a class action simply because more than one state law applies .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues not to allow this bill to completely deny victims their day in court  either in state court or in federal court .,Democratic
that would render this bill completely hypocritical .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on the conyers/nadler/jackson-lee substitute and `` no '' on the main bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  we hear all this hoopla about these coupon settlements  but we do not hear any suggestion as to what to do about them .,Democratic
there are a lot of situations where corporations are ripping people off for small amounts of money .,Democratic
for example  if a person at a checkout counter calibrates the machine to just cheat one out of a few cents  what is one 's recovery in that case ?,Democratic
just a few cents .,Democratic
and the only way one can stop that is with a class action .,Democratic
but they would suggest there is no point in bringing the class action ; as long as they did not rip them off for too much  they ought to get away with it .,Democratic
furthermore  a lot of these coupon settlements are in federal courts anyway  so there is not going to be much change .,Democratic
but some of these coupon cases are the only way that we can rein in corporate abuse .,Democratic
but this bill just increases complications in a gratuitous way .,Democratic
it took a half an hour for the proponents to explain when it is a class action and when it is not a class action .,Democratic
in normal cases they file it in state court .,Democratic
either they certify it or not  and then one goes forward .,Democratic
there is not much complication .,Democratic
but this invites mischief .,Democratic
whether it is really a class action or not  remove it anyway  and let the federal courts mess around with it and mess around with it and mess around with it .,Democratic
they may never get their day in court .,Democratic
and if they do not certify it  what happens to one 's case ?,Democratic
they may not be able to get back to state court .,Democratic
so the fact that they did not certify a class action will deny one the right to even have their day in court .,Democratic
this complicates venue .,Democratic
they do not know where the case is going to be heard .,Democratic
it could be that an injury happens in one state  they have corporations in that state involved  they have state plaintiffs  and here one has to go chasing around  trying to figure out where they are going to be .,Democratic
the attorneys general across the states  47 attorneys general in states and territories  have come out against the bill because it puts the attorneys general in the same crack .,Democratic
they do not know where the case is going to be heard .,Democratic
if they bring a state action in state court  they may get removed .,Democratic
some of the states have better wage laws  civil rights laws  sometimes consumer protections  and if the attorneys general want to come in to protect their own citizens in their own states  they ought to have that right and not get jerked around to federal court .,Democratic
finally  mr.,Democratic
speaker  some federal courts are more clogged up than state courts .,Democratic
some in the same area  the state courts are more clogged up than the federal courts .,Democratic
why do we have to always go into federal court on these cases rather than have some kind of choice ?,Democratic
every time we have a criminal case  it will take preference over the civil cases .,Democratic
and in some cases where we have some terrorist cases or a backlog of federal cases  one may never get to hear their case in federal court .,Democratic
if we want consumers to get timely justice  we need to defeat this bill  and i hope that is what we do .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the substitute .,Democratic
one of the problems with the substitute is you have to debate all of the different issues all at once .,Democratic
if we had the opportunity to introduce individual amendments  we could have discussed them one at a time and had a much more coherent discussion .,Democratic
as it has been said  the underlying bill does not extinguish the right to get to court but it does gratuitously complicate the litigation .,Democratic
it does not fix coupons  it just moves them from state court to federal courts .,Democratic
it adds procedural hurdles  and this substitute removes many of those hurdles .,Democratic
the main thing it does is it carves out many of the different cases that belong in state court or at least ought to have the opportunity in the state court .,Democratic
it also fixes the yo-yo effect where you start off in state court  get removed to federal court  federal court does not certify the class  and then what happens ?,Democratic
i guess you come back to state court or  i do not know  you might not be able to get back to state court .,Democratic
you may end up in a procedural trap where you have lost your case just in the time it takes to get over there and try to get back .,Democratic
this amendment fixes that quagmire .,Democratic
it also carves out  as has been said  the state civil rights cases where some states have civil rights laws that are stronger and cover different people  different classes than the federal laws .,Democratic
wage and hour laws  some states have better laws than the federal court .,Democratic
mass torts where you have not class actions per se  but a lot of different litigants all in the same state .,Democratic
it fixes the problem with attorneys general in bringing a case in state court on behalf of not only members of their state  but if the injury has occurred to a lot of other people  the attorney general might want to bring that case .,Democratic
i have a letter  mr.,Democratic
speaker  signed on this specific issue by 47 attorneys general .,Democratic
it also denies benefits under the bill for tax traitors  those who move their corporate headquarters off shore to avoid corporate taxes ; and it also provides a limitation on sealed settlements that the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Democratic
nadler ) xz4002890 has been very active in making sure that cases that are settled can not be sealed beyond public view  unless if such a sealing would violate public health or other important considerations .,Democratic
this is a well-reasoned substitute .,Democratic
it eliminates many but not all of the problems in the underlying bill  and i would hope that the house would adopt the substitute .,Democratic
of attorneys general  washington  dc  february 7  2005 .,Democratic
dear senate majority leader frist and senate minority leader reid : we  the undersigned state attorneys general  write to express our concern regarding one limited aspect of pending senate bill 5  the `` class action fairness act  '' or any similar legislation .,Democratic
we take no position on the act as a general matter and  indeed  there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act .,Democratic
we join together  however  in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor 's potential amendment to s. 5  or any similar legislation  clarifying that the act does not apply to  and would have no effect on  actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens .,Democratic
as attorneys general  we frequently investigate and bring actions against defendants who have caused harm to our citizens .,Democratic
these cases are usually brought pursuant to the attorney general 's parens patriae authority under our respective consumer protection and antitrust statutes .,Democratic
in some instances  such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state .,Democratic
it is our concern that certain provisions of s. 5 might be misinterpreted to hamper the ability of the attorneys general to bring such actions  thereby impeding one means of protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its resulting harm .,Democratic
the attorneys general have been very successful in litigation initiated to protect the rights of our consumers .,Democratic
for example  in the pharmaceutical industry  the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large  often foreign-owned  drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs .,Democratic
such cases have resulted in recoveries of approximately 235 million dollars  the majority of which is earmarked for consumer restitution .,Democratic
in several instances  the states ' recoveries provided one hundred percent reimbursement directly to individual consumers of the overcharges they suffered as a result of the illegal activities of the defendants .,Democratic
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets of those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices  senior citizens living on fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance .,Democratic
we encourage you to support the aforementioned amendment exempting all actions brought by state attorneys general from the provisions of s. 5  or any similar legislation .,Democratic
it is important to all of our constituents  but especially to the poor  elderly and disabled  that the provisions of the act not be misconstrued and that we maintain the enforcement authority needed to protect them from illegal practices .,Democratic
we respectfully submit that the overall purposes of the legislation would not be impaired by such an amendment that merely clarifies the existing authority of our respective states .,Democratic
thank you for your consideration of this very important matter .,Democratic
please contact any of us if you have questions or comments .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i rise today to oppose this misguided legislation to limit the ability of average americans to seek redress for injury and harm caused by corporate malfeasance .,Democratic
do n't be fooled by the title of this bill .,Democratic
congress is not standing up for the average american under this bill .,Democratic
it 's not fixing inequities in our judicial system .,Democratic
it 's making those inequities worse by giving the upper hand to big corporations .,Democratic
i wo n't vote for this republican-sponsored hoax .,Democratic
it unfairly threatens the very people we are all elected to protect .,Democratic
when the so-called party of local control makes it a top priority to move class action cases from state to federal court  there 's an ulterior motive .,Democratic
do n't believe the myth my republican colleagues want to sell you .,Democratic
class action suits are n't frivolous .,Democratic
they allow average americans financially unable to launch a judicial battle on their own the means to seek redress for injury or death of a loved one .,Democratic
they empower consumers to challenge wrongdoings by wealthy corporations who would otherwise ignore their appeal .,Democratic
i do n't think that the american public would be satisfied knowing that if this bill passes  the accountability of companies like eron would be held less accountable .,Democratic
and the makers of vioxx and other dangerous drugs would be held less accountable .,Democratic
it is truthful  law-abiding citizens who will lose if this bill becomes law  apparently  in america today  we have government for  by  and of corporate interests and not the people .,Democratic
i ask my colleagues to stand up for real people and vote against this shameful bill .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the house has considered similar legislation in 1999  2002  and 2003 .,Democratic
on each of those occasions  i voted `` no '' -- not because i was unalterably opposed to congress acting on this subject  but because in my judgment the defects of those bills outweighed their potential benefits .,Democratic
when it was announced that this bill would be considered  i hoped that the pattern would be broken and that this time i would be able to support the legislation .,Democratic
and if the conyers substitute had been adopted  that would have been the case .,Democratic
adoption of the substitute would have greatly improved the legislation .,Democratic
it would have reaffirmed the authority and ability of each state 's attorney general to carry out his or her duties under state law .,Democratic
it would have made sure that the bill would not prejudice people with complaints about violations of their civil rights .,Democratic
it would have properly focused the legislation on class actions unrelated to personal injuries .,Democratic
it would have added important protections for the public 's right to know about the proceedings in our courts .,Democratic
and it would have made other changes that would have improved the bill .,Democratic
unfortunately  the substitute was not adopted -- and i have come to the reluctant conclusion that i must vote against the bill .,Democratic
that conclusion is reluctant because in several ways this bill is better -- or  more accurately  less bad -- than its predecessors .,Democratic
unlike earlier versions  s. 5 would not have a retroactive effect  so it would not affect pending cases .,Democratic
it also does not include a provision for immediate interlocutory appeals of denials of class action certification  or for a stay of all discovery while the appeal was pending .,Democratic
and in several other ways  it differs for the better from previous versions .,Democratic
however  while the bill is less bad  in my opinion it still is not good enough .,Democratic
i remain unconvinced that the problem the bill purports to address is so great as to require such a sweeping remedy  and i am still concerned that in too many cases the side-effects of this treatment will be more severe than the disease .,Democratic
mr. speaker  one of the most important rights we have as americans is the ability to seek redress from the courts when we believe our rights have been abridged or we have been improperly treated .,Democratic
and  when a complaint arises under a state law  it is both appropriate and desirable that it be heard in state court because those are the most convenient and with the best understanding of state laws and local conditions .,Democratic
of course  it is appropriate to provide for removing some state cases to federal courts .,Democratic
but i think that should be more the exception than the rule  and i think this bill tends to reverse that .,Democratic
i think it excessively tilts the balance between the states and the federal government so as to throw too many cases into already-overburdened federal courts -- with the predictable result that too many will be dismissed without adequate consideration of their merits .,Democratic
so  while i respect those who have urged the house to pass this bill  i can not vote for it .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time  and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage in a debate on his time  but i will take 30 seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said .,Democratic
in every one of those cases on the wheel of rhetoric that the gentleman put up  those that were found guilty  those who were found to be responsible  those who were found to be culpable of doing harmful things to our community admitted it  paid a fine  paid a penalty  that was approved by a judge  and that is the fact ; that the gentleman took cases of people who admitted with their actions there was wrongdoing involved .,Democratic
and if they had not been caught by this system  i ask the gentleman  what system would they be caught by ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to the so-called `` class action fairness act.,Democratic
'' i have strong objections to not only to the text of the bill itself but also to the very process by which it was strong-armed by the republican leadership past the judiciary committee .,Democratic
this process did not allow any opportunity for committee members to raise our objections or to work constructively to fix the major problems in this legislation .,Democratic
this circumvention of regular order is being sold to us with a myriad of excuses  one of them is that the bill is a simple procedural fix for a judicial crisis with nothing controversial in it .,Democratic
nothing could be further from the truth .,Democratic
this bill is a federal mandate to undermine and all but kill the ability to raise class actions cases in state courts .,Democratic
under this so-called `` procedural bill  '' almost every class action lawsuit would be removed from state jurisdiction and forced onto an already overburdened federal judiciary .,Democratic
moving these cases to federal court will make litigation more costly  more time-consuming and less likely that victims can get their rightful day in court at all .,Democratic
this bill is so preposterously far-reaching it would prevent state courts from considering class action cases that only involve state laws .,Democratic
we have already added so many state cases to federal jurisdiction that if this bill passes victims will be added to the substantial backlog of federal cases and will likely find it difficult to ever have their cases heard .,Democratic
it should be obvious to even the most casual observer that the intent of this bill is to prevent class action lawsuits from ever being heard .,Democratic
members should make no mistake about it -- if we pass this misguided legislation  we will have effectively shut the door on civil rights  on workers rights and on anyone injured through corporate negligence .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing one of the most destructive and far reaching civil justice measures ever considered by this body .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding me this time .,Democratic
i am opposed to this bill because it reflects a misunderstanding of the proper way to build a successful career and a gross misinterpretation of our constitutional tradition .,Democratic
with respect to its misunderstanding of the best way to build a career  i think that these personal retraining accounts  although clearly well intentioned  have exactly the wrong effect on an unemployed person .,Democratic
the purpose of workforce investment is not to move a person from a position of unemployment to a position of employment for a while .,Democratic
the purpose of the workforce investment is to move a person from dependency to opportunity and eventually to prosperity .,Democratic
the great dividing line in the american economy is whether one has 2 years of college or not .,Democratic
people with more than 2 years of college tend to have stable jobs and high and rising incomes .,Democratic
this bill says to a person who is laid off from an industrial industry or some other employer like that take the first job that comes along .,Democratic
as the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
mcdermott ) xz4002620 said  they are virtually compelled to do that .,Democratic
the first job is not always the best job .,Democratic
but  more importantly  from the public 's point of view  it may be a temporary job .,Democratic
it will move the person from a period of unemployment to a brief period of reemployment to another period of unemployment .,Democratic
our goal should not be temporary employment .,Democratic
our goal should be opportunity and prosperity in the long run .,Democratic
with respect to the constitutional misinterpretation  the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003632 will offer an amendment later in this debate that needs to be adopted .,Democratic
we are not opposed to faith-based organizations continuing the work they are presently doing in job training .,Democratic
they do a great job and they should continue .,Democratic
if the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003632 amendment passes  that work will not be discontinued .,Democratic
if the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003632 amendment passes  here is what will happen : we think that with federal money a religious organization should not be able to say we will not hire catholics to serve meals at a clinic .,Democratic
we think with federal money  an organization should not be able to say we do not hire jews to do job training .,Democratic
we think with federal money  people should not be able to say we do not want evangelical christians or muslims or buddhists doing job counseling .,Democratic
this country started because we wanted to get away from religious persecution and discrimination .,Democratic
it is an abrogation of our constitutional traditions to enshrine that in the law  and that is what this bill does .,Democratic
the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003632 amendment corrects that mistake and it should be adopted .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  next month my family and i will observe my wife 's jewish tradition and recite the ancient story  the passover at our family seder .,Democratic
later this month  i will honor my religious tradition and commemorate christ 's crucifixion on good friday and his resurrection on easter sunday .,Democratic
and today i will honor the principles behind the united states constitution and vote for the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003641 amendment .,Democratic
the principle here is that when an organization takes federal money  it takes with it the responsibility not to discriminate .,Democratic
i do not think we should ever have a situation in this country where an organization takes taxpayers ' money collected from everyone and then says if they want to be a job counselor in our agency  they can not be a catholic  they can not be jewish  they can not be muslim  they can not be an evangelical christian .,Democratic
our religious organizations are free and should remain free to discriminate with their own funds .,Democratic
that is the religious liberty that our friends on the other side refer to correctly .,Democratic
but that liberty does not extend to the power to use someone else 's money to subsidize the practice of one 's religion .,Democratic
that is the establishment of a religion which is specifically precluded by the first amendment of the constitution .,Democratic
it would be a travesty to reject the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003641 amendment .,Democratic
it would be wholly consistent with the religious principles of this country to adopt it .,Democratic
i would urge its adoption .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i include for the record a letter signed by 14 attorneys general  including darrell mcgraw  the attorney general of the state of west virginia  in opposition to this bill .,Democratic
state of new york  office of the attorney general  albany  ny  february 7  2005 .,Democratic
dear mr .,Democratic
majority leader and mr .,Democratic
minority leader : on behalf of the attorneys general of california  illinois  iowa  kentucky  maine  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  new jersey  new mexico  new york  oklahoma  oregon  vermont and west virginia  we are writing in opposition to s. 5  the so-called `` class action fairness act  '' which will be debated today and is scheduled to be voted on this week .,Democratic
despite improvements over similar legislation considered in prior years  we believe s. 5 still unduly limits the right of individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their state courts .,Democratic
we therefore strongly recommend that this legislation not be enacted in its present form .,Democratic
as you know  under s. 5  almost all class actions brought by private individuals in state court based on state law claims would be removed to federal court  and  as explained below  many of these cases may not be able to continue as class actions .,Democratic
we are concerned with such a limitation on the availability of the class action device because  particularly in these times of tightening state budgets  class actions provide an important `` private attorney general '' supplement to the efforts of state attorneys general to prosecute violations of state consumer protection  civil rights  labor  public health and environmental laws .,Democratic
we recognize that some class action lawsuits in both state and federal courts have resulted in only minimal benefits to class members  despite the award of substantial attorneys ' fees .,Democratic
while we support targeted efforts to prevent such abuses and preserve the integrity of the class action mechanism  we believe s. 5 goes too far .,Democratic
by fundamentally altering the basic principles of federalism  s. 5  if enacted in its present form  would result in far greater harm than good .,Democratic
it therefore is not surprising that organizations such as aarp  afl-cio  consumer federation of america  consumers union  leadership conference on civil rights  naacp and public citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form .,Democratic
1 .,Democratic
class actions should not be `` federalized '' s. 5 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction  and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in or removed to federal court .,Democratic
this transfer of jurisdiction in cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their own state tort and contract laws  and will impair their ability to establish consistent interpretations of those laws .,Democratic
there is no compelling need or empirical support for such a sweeping change in our long-established system for adjudicating state law issues .,Democratic
in fact  by transferring most state court class actions to an already overburdened federal court system  this bill will delay ( if not deny ) justice to substantial numbers of injured citizens .,Democratic
moreover  s. 5 is fundamentally 2 .,Democratic
clarification is needed that s. 5 does not apply to state attorney general actions state attorneys general frequently investigate and bring actions against defendants who have caused harm to our citizens  usually pursuant to the attorney general 's parens patriae authority under our respective state consumer protection and antitrust statutes .,Democratic
in some instances  such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state .,Democratic
we are concerned that certain provisions of s. 5 might be misinterpreted to impede the ability of the attorneys general to bring such actions  thereby interfering with one means of protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its resulting harm .,Democratic
that attorney general enforcement actions should proceed unimpeded is important to all our constituents  but most significantly to our senior citizens living on 3 .,Democratic
many multi-state class actions cannot be brought in federal court another significant problem with s. 5 is that many federal courts have refused to certify multi-state class actions because the court would be required to apply the laws of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs -- even if the laws of those jurisdictions are very similar .,Democratic
thus  cases commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal court may not be able to be continued as class actions in federal court .,Democratic
in theory  injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a separate class action lawsuit in federal court  but that defeats one of the main purposes of class actions  which is to conserve judicial resources .,Democratic
moreover  while the population of some states may be large enough to warrant a separate class action involving only residents of those states  it is very unlikely tbat similar lawsuits will be brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states .,Democratic
this problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of their constitutional power -- either by applying one state 's law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the case  or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny certification on the sole ground that the laws of more than one state would apply to the action .,Democratic
we understand that senator jeff bingaman will be proposing an amendment to address this problem  and that amendment should be adopted .,Democratic
4 .,Democratic
civil rights and labor cases should be exempted proponents of s. 5 point to allegedly `` collusive '' consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs ' attorneys received substantial fee awards  while the class members merely received `` coupons '' towards the purchase of other goods sold by defendants .,Democratic
accordingly  this `` reform '' should apply only to consumer class actions .,Democratic
class action treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of discrimination  and there is no apparent need to place limitations on these types of actions .,Democratic
senator kennedy reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue  which also should be adopted .,Democratic
5 .,Democratic
the notification provisions are misguided s. 5 requires that federal and state regulators  and in many cases state attorneys general  be notified of proposed class action settlements  and be provided with copies of the complaint  class notice  proposed settlement and other materials .,Democratic
apparently this provision is intended to protect against `` collusive '' settlements between defendants and plaintiffs ' counsel  but those materials would be unlikely to reveal evidence of collusion  and thus would provide little or no basis for objecting to the settlement .,Democratic
without clear authority in the legislation to more closely examine defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed settlement ( particularly out-of-state defendants over whom subpoena authority may in some circumstances be limited )  the notification provision equal access to the american system of justice is a foundation of our democracy .,Democratic
s. 5 would effect a sweeping reordering of our nation 's system of justice that will disenfranchise individual citizens from obtaining redress for harm  and thereby impede efforts against egregious corporate wrongdoing .,Democratic
although we ful1y support the goal of preventing abusive class action settlements  and would be willing to provide assistance in your effort to implement necessary reforms  we are likewise committed to maintaining our federal system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the public .,Democratic
for these reasons  we oppose s. 5 in its present form .,Democratic
sincerely  mr.,Democratic
speaker  i yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
markey ) xz4002530  the dean of our delegation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
27  the job training improvement act .,Democratic
this bill fails to improve the workforce investment act and falls short of the promises our government made to provide training and career opportunities for the unemployed .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 is fatally flawed and undermines our current national workforce policy .,Democratic
it eliminates various worker-training programs  rolls back protection against religious discrimination  and potentially damages the stability of important social programs .,Democratic
we can not neglect the unemployed  underemployed and dislocated workers of america who need ample and widespread funding for federal job training services .,Democratic
despite a suffering economy and high unemployment  this bill undercuts the ability of our government to provide for these vital workers and erodes congressional authority and accountability over workforce funds .,Democratic
under the provisions of h.r.,Democratic
27  funding will be shifted from wia partner programs to pay for the wia infrastructure and core services costs .,Democratic
this transfer will weaken vital programs such as tanf  adult education  unemployment insurance  child support enforcement  and veterans employment programs .,Democratic
why would we threaten these vital social programs by passing a flawed bill that does not even assure more training would result from the transfer of funds ?,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 also contains explicit discriminatory provisions .,Democratic
by repealing long-standing civil rights protections that were signed into law by president reagan  this bill allows job-training providers to discriminate on the basis of religion .,Democratic
since 1982  these provisions have been included in the bill and received bipartisan support .,Democratic
we can not allow this gross inequity to tear at the fabric of a fundamental american principle -- the inalienable right to fair and equal treatment under the law .,Democratic
this is why i strongly support congressman scott 's amendment that will restore these basic civil rights and my faith in our legislative process .,Democratic
we can not allow ourselves to drastically depart from previous workforce policy by eliminating worker training programs  destabilizing essential social programs  and writing discriminatory provisions into law .,Democratic
this so-called workforce investment act is not an acceptable or responsible proposal to provide needed services to our nation 's unemployed .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on final passage .,Democratic
mr. speaker  the outsourcing of good-paying american jobs to other countries is a crisis that touches every community in the united states .,Democratic
up to half a million jobs have been outsourced over the past 3 years to countries like china  india  and mexico .,Democratic
this at a time when there are 8 million americans out of work .,Democratic
americans now understand that outsourcing negatively impacts every segment of our economy .,Democratic
not only have 2.7 million jobs been lost in our once-vibrant manufacturing sector since the beginning of this administration but white collar jobs are being offshored as well .,Democratic
according to one report  181  000 computer jobs will be moved offshore by the end of 2005 .,Democratic
last year  state and local governments outsourced $ 10 billion of public projects .,Democratic
what we are witnessing today is a full-scale erosion of the american workforce  with millions seeking skills to improve their current employment situation .,Democratic
this bill undermines our job training system and our economy alike .,Democratic
this motion seeks to provide assistance to veterans  provide workers who lost their jobs to outsourcing with job training assistance  allowances to relocate to where they can find work and other forms of income support .,Democratic
this bill destroys the functioning elements of our job training system .,Democratic
it does not  quote  improve our delivery of these vital services for unemployed americans .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i guess it is politically popular to attack lawyers and judges  but what i am concerned about is what this bill will do to average people who are seeking remedies for being mistreated .,Democratic
i want to read an excerpt from the leadership conference on civil rights  afl/cio  and the alliance for justice statement .,Democratic
one of things they point out is that nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in anti-discrimination and wage and hour class action litigation .,Democratic
they point out by allowing dozens of employees to bring one lawsuit together  the class action device is frequently the only means for low-wage workers who have been denied mere dollars a day to recover their lost wages .,Democratic
moreover  class actions are also often the only means to effectively change a policy of discrimination .,Democratic
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in states under the law of the state in which the claim arises .,Democratic
the reason is that state wage and hour laws typically provide more complete remedies for victims of wage and hour violations than the federal wage and hour statute .,Democratic
for instance  the federal fair labor standards act offers no protection  no protection for a worker who works 30 hours and is paid for 20  so long as the worker 's total pay for the 30 hours worked exceeds the federal minimum wage .,Democratic
however  many states have payment of wage laws that would require that the workers be fully paid for those additional 10 hours of work .,Democratic
also  federal law provides no remedy for part-time workers who often work 10- to 16-hour days  yet earn no overtime because they work less than 40 hours per week .,Democratic
at least six states and territories  however  including california and alaska  require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours of work in a single day .,Democratic
likewise  state laws increasingly provide greater civil rights protections than federal laws .,Democratic
for example  every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability .,Democratic
some of these state statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act  including california  minnesota  new jersey  new york  rhode island  washington  and west virginia .,Democratic
in addition  every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment .,Democratic
some of these state laws  including those in california  michigan  ohio and the district of columbia  contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination and employment act .,Democratic
in addition  many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law .,Democratic
for example  many states provide expanded benefits based on marital status  and i could go on and on and on .,Democratic
the point of the matter here is that this legislation is basically denying people the rights and the protections that many of them have fought so hard to earn in their states  and it leads to more injustice and more unfairness .,Democratic
leadership conference on civil rights  alliance for justice  afl-cio  washington  dc  february 2  2005 .,Democratic
exempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from s. 5 dear senators  on behalf of the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations  we write to urge you to support an amendment being offered by senators kennedy and cantwell to the class action fairness act ( s. 5 )  which would exempt civil rights and wage and hour state law cases .,Democratic
the amendment is necessary in order to ensure that s. 5 does not adversely impact the workplace and civil rights of ordinary americans by making it extremely difficult to enforce civil rights and labor rights .,Democratic
during congress ' extensive examination of the merits of class action lawsuits  nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in anti-discrimination and wage and hour class-action litigation .,Democratic
by allowing dozens of employees to bring one lawsuit together  the class-action device is frequently the only means for low wage workers who have been denied mere dollars a day to recover their lost wages .,Democratic
moreover  class actions also are often the only means to effectively change a policy of discrimination .,Democratic
these suits level the playing field between individuals and those with more power and resources  and permit courts to decide cases more efficiently .,Democratic
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in state courts under the law of the state in which the claims arise .,Democratic
the reason is that state wage and hour laws typically provide more complete remedies for victims of wage and hour violations than the federal wage and hour statute .,Democratic
for instance  the federal fair labor standards act ( flsa ) offers no protection for a worker who works 30 hours and is paid for 20  so long as the worker 's total pay for the 30 hours worked exceeds the federal minimum wage .,Democratic
however  many states have `` payment of wage '' laws that would require that the worker be fully paid for those additional 10 hours of work .,Democratic
also  federal law provides no remedy for part-time workers who often work 10-16 hour days  yet earn no overtime because they work less than 40 hours per week .,Democratic
at least six states and territories  however  including california and alaska  require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours are worked in a single day .,Democratic
likewise  state laws increasingly provide greater civil rights protection than federal law .,Democratic
for example  every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability .,Democratic
some of these states statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act  including california  minnesota  new jersey  new york  rhode island  washington  and west virginia .,Democratic
in addition  every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment  and some of these state laws -- including those of california  michigan  ohio and the district of columbia -- contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination in employment act ( adea ) .,Democratic
in addition  many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law .,Democratic
for example  the following states provide protection for marital status : alaska  california  connecticut  delaware  florida  hawaii  illinois  maryland  michigan  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north dakota  oregon  virginia  washington  and wisconsin .,Democratic
moreover  several states have expanded title vii 's ban on national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ancestry  or place of birth  or citizenship status .,Democratic
these states include arkansas  california  colorado  connecticut  hawaii  illinois  indiana  kansas  maine  massachusetts  missouri  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  south dakota  vermont  west virginia  wisconsin  wyoming  and the virgin islands .,Democratic
finally  31 states have enacted legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination in the workplace -- an important protection given the rapid increase in the ability to gather this type of information .,Democratic
the 31 states are arizona  arkansas  california  connecticut  delaware  hawaii  iowa  kansas  louisiana  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  nevada  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north carolina  oklahoma  oregon  rhode island  south dakota  texas  utah  vermont  virginia  washington  and wisconsin .,Democratic
in addition  florida and illinois have enacted more limited protections against genetic discrimination .,Democratic
under s. 5  citizens are denied the right to use their own state courts to bring class actions against corporations that violate these state wage and hour and state civil rights laws  even where that corporation has hundreds of employees in that state .,Democratic
moving these state law cases into federal court will delay and likely deny justice for working men and women and victims of discrimination .,Democratic
the federal courts are already overburdened .,Democratic
additionally  federal courts are less likely to certify classes or provide relief for violations of state law .,Democratic
in light of the lack of any compelling need to sweep state wage and hour and civil rights claims into the scope of the bill  we urge you to support an amendment to exempt these claims from the provisions of s. 5 .,Democratic

mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to s. 5  the class action fairness act .,Democratic
despite its name  this bill is anything but fair to the class action device that has provided redress to large numbers of american citizens who have been harmed by the same defendant or a group of defendants .,Democratic
class action procedures have made it possible for injured americans to aggregate small claims that might not otherwise warrant the expense of individual litigation .,Democratic
this bill before us will effectively undermine the utility  practicality  and choice the class action mechanism has offered to injured persons with legitimate claims against powerful entities .,Democratic
there appear to be improvements in this bill from the bill we considered last congress ; yet there could and should be more improvements .,Democratic
but the trend thus far this session is to dispense with regular order  deny committee consideration  and to leave members with 1 to 2 minutes to hurriedly voice our concerns .,Democratic
i can guarantee my colleagues  having practiced law for over 20 years  that the core provisions of this bill will invite prolonged satellite litigation into ill-defined or undefined terms in this bill  clogging the federal courts and denying prompt justice to worthy claimants .,Democratic
for example  where `` significant relief '' is sought against a home state defendant  the court has no jurisdiction .,Democratic
what is significant and what is not significant ?,Democratic
also  and worse in my judgment  no longer will a coherent description of the class be sufficient before the trial on the merit proceeds .,Democratic
under the bill the judge must first know with certainty the absolute number of the plaintiff class  because whether he may or must decline to hear the case depends on whether a `` magic '' number of plaintiffs are citizens of the state where the lawsuit was filed .,Democratic
there are other examples too complicated to address here in the time that we have available .,Democratic
but let me just say that juxtaposed against the smattering of cases paraded by the supporters of this bill as justification for this upheaval in our justice system are countless class action lawsuits by principled attorneys and courageous plaintiffs that have exposed deliberate wrongdoing  obtained justice for american citizens  and vindicated the values of fair play and equal justice that define our society .,Democratic
america is distinguished from other countries because of its legal system both criminal and civil .,Democratic
is it perfect ?,Democratic
no .,Democratic
but the majority wages countless legislative assaults on the entire system rather than confined  deliberative  surgical repairs .,Democratic
under this bill  one bad judge  we condemn all of the judges in the system .,Democratic
one excessive jury award  let us overhaul the entire jury system .,Democratic
one irresponsible lawyer  let us punish all lawyers .,Democratic
and here let us take these actions without any committee hearings  markup  or debate .,Democratic
what could be more irresponsible to our constituents ?,Democratic
whatever happened to the notion that we were making our court systems convenient to people ?,Democratic
in some of our states  the federal courts are far removed from the places where individual litigants live .,Democratic
and what is it with the notion all of a sudden that my states rights friends believe that the federal courts and the federal government can solve every problem in our society ?,Democratic
that is just simply absurd  inconsistent with any kind of consistent philosophy about federalism .,Democratic
i think we should defeat this flawed bill  and i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  the history is ambiguous .,Democratic
courts have been on both sides .,Democratic
the principle is what is involved .,Democratic
we are told that if we adopt this amendment  we are denying the liberty to religious organizations .,Democratic
the liberty that is being asked  frankly i am disappointed to hear this asserted  and i think the greatest denigration of religious organizations coming forward here are those who are saying this : there are religious groups in this country who are eager to help people in need  but if they get federal tax dollars to help people in need and they are forced to associate with heathens and unbelievers and infidels  then they will be driven away .,Democratic
what is so terrible about saying to the orthodox jews in brooklyn who were cited  you want to help the people in brooklyn  the people you want to help will be black and hispanic  they will be white and poor and jewish and christian  if you really want to help them  on your own  whatever you want to do  you can do .,Democratic
but if you want all of those people in brooklyn who paid federal taxes  if you want a share of their federal taxes to run a program to help them  god forbid  i guess you mean this literally  god forbid you should have to hire one of them .,Democratic
martin luther king said  and it is sadly still true  that one of the most segregated times in america is the hour of worship .,Democratic
so understand that when you empower the religious groups to discriminate based on religion  you will also de facto empower some segregation .,Democratic
those orthodox jewish groups in brooklyn will hire very few black people in brooklyn .,Democratic
and if in fact you have a policy that says all the money is going to go in these areas to the religious groups  then what about people who are not religious ?,Democratic
the constitution says you should not discriminate against them .,Democratic
you may not think much of them  but you should not be discriminating against them  but they can not ever get a job .,Democratic
and you talk about message .,Democratic
i love this message .,Democratic
what we are going to be saying if you win here in the house of representatives is  attention all shiites  do not hire sunnis .,Democratic
that is your principle .,Democratic
apparently  we are going to be encouraging the people in iraq with iraqi government money or american government money  a lot of it is going to iraq  do you really think you want to send that message to the shiites that when they try to rebuild their country they should not hire sunnis ?,Democratic
and what are you saying ?,Democratic
that there is something somehow so corrosive about associating with someone of a different religion that it disables you from doing good ?,Democratic
what kind of motivation do you impute to these people ?,Democratic
you want to do good  but you should not have to associate with one of those people .,Democratic
by the way  even you acknowledge that the people being served have to be of all religions .,Democratic
so this religious purity that apparently is so essential has already been dissolved .,Democratic
but here is the point : we are being asked to say to americans  yes  you will pay taxes for this ; but the taxes you pay  you are not eligible for a job because you believe in the wrong god .,Democratic
or you believe in god in the wrong way .,Democratic
you believe in the wrong denomination .,Democratic
or you do not believe .,Democratic
again  what are you saying ?,Democratic
is it really the case that religious organizations  that they are somehow so angry towards outsiders  that they feel so unclean that they can not help people in need if they have to associate with people who are otherwise perfectly qualified  who believe in the mission of this entity  but they do not share the same religion ?,Democratic
i hope we will not so characterize religious people as being so narrow and so biased towards people not of their own religion that they can not even work with them in this common cause to which you say they are committed .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Democratic
evans ) xz4001260 .,Democratic
mr .,Democratic
evans .,Democratic
mr. speaker  h.r.,Democratic
27  the administration 's job training reauthorization bill  would  among other misguided actions  harm veterans ' employment programs and critical vocational rehabilitation services .,Democratic
specifically  this bill would permit states to siphon off federal resources from already underfunded veterans ' employment programs that operate under state `` one-stop '' centers .,Democratic
veterans and disabled job seekers do not deserve this .,Democratic
mr. speaker  in the 107th congress  we passed in a bipartisan manner the jobs for veterans act  legislation to reorganize  update  and improve these very same veterans ' employment and training programs .,Democratic
now is not the time for this bipartisan effort to be unraveled .,Democratic
while our troops are actively engaged in iraq and afghanistan and many others suffering from severe injuries and permanent disabilities  now is not the time to reduce the resources for these critical job training programs .,Democratic
indeed  we need to give these programs the chance to be effective .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i understand that states are facing tremendous fiscal challenges due to the harsh economic times  but clearly taking resources from one chronologically underfunded program is not the answer .,Democratic
the responsible thing for the administration to do  the right thing  would be to adequately support job seekers  especially disabled veterans  as well as to assist the states with infrastructure costs .,Democratic
mr. speaker  this legislation is not responsible and permits already modest resources intended for the nation 's disabled veterans  all who have served our country  to be further diminished .,Democratic
i oppose this legislation and urge a `` no '' vote on the underlying legislation .,Democratic
and as a former marine  i have benefitted from many programs that help veterans with education and training .,Democratic
as a continuation of those efforts  we must not let these people fall through the cracks that we have in our employment laws .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from michigan for the time .,Democratic
sometimes during these debates i like to step in to take a perspective of someone on the committee who is not a lawyer ; but i have to tell my colleagues  the previous speaker  the gentleman from virginia  went to great lengths to talk about the lawyers fees .,Democratic
there is nothing in this bill that limits lawyers fees  and there is not anything in the bill actually that argues for his point  which is apparently that there should be a minimum amount that wrongdoers pay to each individual aggrieved person  which is a novel argument  i have not heard it made by my colleague before  saying that the plaintiffs are receiving too little now .,Democratic
let me explain very briefly why it is that we have situations like that .,Democratic
those of us who are individuals of modest means  if we have been aggrieved by a major company  if they have done something that has harmed our health or our community or our family  we as individuals frankly do not have the ability to take on a major company to stop them from doing the wrongful things  to make sure they understand that there is a cost of doing it .,Democratic
so we join together as a community and we bring these actions as a group .,Democratic
we can not  frankly  pay the lawyer up front so they are paid on contingencies  and that is the way these actions get taken .,Democratic
one thing the gentleman from virginia did not say even once through that whole wheel of rhetoric was that any of those that were held accountable by juries of their peers were not guilty of those things .,Democratic
in those cases  those parties  each and every one of them  on the wheel of rhetoric actually was found by a judge or a jury to have done substantial bad things to the community .,Democratic
the system actually worked in those cases .,Democratic
we can quibble about the person  the individual that wound up getting a payment .,Democratic
there were so many of them  millions of people who had been harmed by those companies  that when they were done divvying up what seemed like a very large judgment  tens of millions of dollars  there was only left a 35  40-cent coupon and the like .,Democratic
i stand perfectly ready to vote in favor of an amendment by the gentleman from virginia to have minimum payments to people who have been harmed .,Democratic
if the gentleman thinks it is not enough that they get 35 cents  i am with him .,Democratic
some of those companies did outrageous things to our community  and they should be held accountable .,Democratic
if my colleague thinks a 35-cent check is not enough  i am with him .,Democratic
let us make minimum amounts that they pay for the injuries  that they have to get  because the harm is so great .,Democratic
i want to remind my colleagues and the citizens watching this why the system is structured this way .,Democratic
imagine for a moment if someone who is making a shoddy automobile  who was not paying attention to whether sharp objects got into a cereal box  did not have to be concerned about lawsuits anymore .,Democratic
do my colleagues think they would really say let us hire that extra safety precaution  that extra employee to keep an eye out for consumers ?,Democratic
no .,Democratic
they would be less inclined to do that .,Democratic
the system works as it is intended .,Democratic
are there abuses ?,Democratic
i am sorry to say that there are some  and i wish we would address some of them in this legislation which  of course  we do not ; but frankly to stand before the wheel of rhetoric  which really is a wheel of bad doers who got caught by the justice system  which we are trying to dismantle here today  and say this is evidence that the system does not work is entirely the opposite of the truth  unless my colleagues believe that a jury of people 's peers can not make these informed decisions  that we are the only people brilliant enough to make these decisions .,Democratic
i love these small government types who believe we have better judgment on these things than 12 men and women in a community  then we have to believe that the system in those cases worked .,Democratic
i would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the conyers/nadler/jackson-lee substitute only puts lipstick on a fraud .,Democratic
it still leaves a very  very flawed bill ; but at least we go from being completely destructive to only being moderately destructive  and we protect ourselves from some of the worst abuses .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge a `` yes '' vote on the substitute  a `` no '' vote on the base bill  and i urge us to stop this drumbeat on the other side of blaming average americans for being victimized by big corporations .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this debate is about one question that each member and each american should ask himself or herself .,Democratic
this is the question : should any american citizen have to pass someone else 's private religious test to qualify for a tax-funded job ?,Democratic
i think the vast majority of americans would answer that question  absolutely not .,Democratic
should the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
boehner ) xz4000360  who is the author of this bill  have to come to me if i get a $ 5 million job computer training grant from the federal government under this bill  should the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
boehner ) xz4000360 have to come to me and answer a 20-point religious questionnaire ?,Democratic
should the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
boehner ) xz4000360 have to say whether or not he believes in jesus christ  whether or not he believes in evolution  whether or not he believes in the literal interpretation of the new testament ?,Democratic
i do not think the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Democratic
boehner ) xz4000360 should have to answer those kinds of questions to me as a recipient of a $ 5 million job training grant .,Democratic
and without the scott amendment  that is exactly what could happen under this bill .,Democratic
for those who oppose the scott amendment  let me say what you are endorsing .,Democratic
you are saying it is okay for a church associated with bob jones university  at least based on its past philosophy  it can take a $ 1 million job training grant and pay for a sign that says  no jews or catholics need apply here for a federally funded job .,Democratic
do you really think that is right ?,Democratic
what the opponents of the scott amendment are saying is that the members of a white church who received a $ 1 million job training grant can say to an african american applicant  you do not belong to our church .,Democratic
even though you are totally qualified for this federally funded job  we are not going to hire you .,Democratic
what this bill would say  without the scott amendment  is that someone could say to a single mom trying to find a job in our religious faith  we do not believe single mothers should work  so we are not going to hire you  even though you are fully qualified for this job .,Democratic
religious discrimination is wrong .,Democratic
to subsidize it in the year 2005 i find unbelievable .,Democratic
it is unbelievable that on the very day american soldiers are risking their lives in iraq  and perhaps some have given their lives today in iraq to give the iraqis religious freedom  we are debating a bill on the floor of this house that would say an american citizen can be denied a federally funded  tax-funded job for simply one reason  the exercise of your religious faith .,Democratic
religious freedom is not just any freedom ; it is the first freedom .,Democratic
it is the first freedom enunciated in the bill of rights .,Democratic
it is the freedom upon which all other freedoms we cherish in this country are built .,Democratic
the founding fathers thought so much about that freedom  about religious freedom  they put in the first 16 words of the first amendment these words : `` congress shall pass no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.,Democratic
'' if saying that someone has to lose a job to support his or her family because they are exercising their own deeply-felt religious faith  if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion  what is ?,Democratic
if saying we are going to take away your ability to put food on the table for your children and a job that is paid for by taxpayers  to say that you can not have that job because you do not pass my private religious test  if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion  what is ?,Democratic
the ninth commandment warns people to not bear false witness against thy neighbor .,Democratic
yet repeatedly i have heard on this floor those say on this side of the floor that supporters of the scott amendment are opposed to faith-based groups being involved in providing social services .,Democratic
i would suggest perhaps they should not only preach the ten commandments ; perhaps they should exercise and practice the ninth commandment  because to make that argument is to suggest that the baptist joint committee  the american jewish committee  and numerous other religious groups are somehow opposing faith-based groups ' involvement in federal social service programs .,Democratic
you know that argument is simply not correct .,Democratic
this amendment  the scott amendment  is about one question and one question alone : should any american citizen have to pass another american citizen 's private religious test to qualify for a federally funded job ?,Democratic
i hope the members of this house will respect the founding fathers and the first amendment and the views of the vast majority of american citizens and say  no  you should not be denied a tax-funded job because of the exercise of your religious faith .,Democratic
i urge members on both sides of the aisle to put partisanship and politics aside .,Democratic
vote for religious freedom .,Democratic
vote for the scott amendment .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to engage the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) of the committee on education and the workforce in a colloquy .,Democratic
during our full committee consideration of h.r.,Democratic
27  i offered and withdrew an amendment to ensure that data on high school-aged students participating in adult education programs is publicly available and reported to our committee .,Democratic
we already know that 30 percent of our high school students fail to earn diplomas with their peers .,Democratic
in the hispanic community  that figure is nearly 50 percent .,Democratic
many of our adult education providers report that high school-aged students are flooding their programs .,Democratic
we can not continue to allow our high school students to slip through the cracks .,Democratic
our first step in shining the light on this issue is to make sure that we have accurate and regularly reported data .,Democratic
at full committee  the gentleman offered to work with me to ensure that these concerns are addressed in the reports that our committee received from the department of education .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr.,Democratic
scott ) xz4003641 amendment to h.r.,Democratic
27 .,Democratic
twenty-three years ago  the workforce investment act was first enacted .,Democratic
it established a commonsense clause prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of religion .,Democratic
wia then was originally designed to provide funding for secular social services .,Democratic
clearly  it did not intend to permit government-funded job training programs to engage in religious discrimination when making an employment decision  which is exactly what this bill purports to do .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate not just on the basis of a person 's religious affiliation  but also on how closely they follow the tenets of that religion .,Democratic
this would include religious beliefs on medical treatments ; procedures ; marriage ; pregnancy ; gender ; and  yes  even race .,Democratic
under this bill  if a woman providing workforce rehabilitation services in a faith-based organization was found to be using birth control  she could be fired  demoted  or not promoted .,Democratic
or if a faith-based organization frowned upon women working outside the home  they could deny a woman a job just because of her gender or even deny it to her husband for allowing such a breach .,Democratic
it is simply unamerican to set the clock back on the safeguards provided to protected classes  including religion  sex  race  ethnicity  and sexual orientation .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 would remove these important protections  allowing faith-based organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion  even regarding the secular social services they provide .,Democratic
this bill contains the first ever major rollback of civil rights protections that were established over 40 years ago  and many of us  including myself  have profited from those protections and from those rights granted to us 40 years ago .,Democratic
this is an unconscionable change of federal law  and i can not support a bill with such provisions .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the scott amendment and voting `` no '' on the final passage of this bill that endorses a federal rollback of decades-old civil rights and privacy protections .,Democratic
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  the chairman is correct .,Democratic
the department already collects this data and would be able to highlight this information in its annual report to congress with very little additional work .,Democratic
it is simply a matter of clearly communicating to the department that we would like to see focused information on high school-aged students in adult education reported by race  ethnicity  language proficiency  and program enrollment .,Democratic
i thank the chairman for continuing to work with me and the department to bring this critical information to the forefront .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) for his comments .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me this time  and i rise to oppose this rule to h.r.,Democratic
27  the workforce investment act .,Democratic
the gentleman from ohio  the chairman of the committee on which i serve  is correct .,Democratic
the workforce investment act has been successful .,Democratic
the renewal that is proposed to us today  however  is a step backwards ; and we will hear a great deal about that .,Democratic
there were amendments that were proposed that have not been made in order .,Democratic
these amendments would have created a separate authorization for infrastructure funding for one-stop centers  would have struck the provisions regarding personal reemployment accounts .,Democratic
there was an amendment that would have struck the provisions to consolidate the funding of adult  dislocated worker and employment service ; and an amendment that i would like to address at this moment that i offered that would have increased the authorization by $ 750 million for job training programs under the workforce investment act .,Democratic
between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2006  mr.,Democratic
speaker  funding for the workforce investment act has been reduced by three-quarters of a billion dollars .,Democratic
this is for a program that works .,Democratic
but the funding has been reduced .,Democratic
my amendment would have restored this funding .,Democratic
however  the committee on rules did not see fit to accept the amendment .,Democratic
at a time when there are 7.7 million people unemployed  not counting those who have fallen off the rolls  4.5 million working part-time because they can not find a full-time job that they need  we should be doing more .,Democratic
through the one-stop delivery system  job seekers have access to labor market information  job counseling  and job training to help them get back on their feet .,Democratic
back in 1998 when this bill  this program  was first passed  david broder wrote an article .,Democratic
he said : when senator paul wellstone walked off the floor arm in arm with senator mike dewine of ohio  bipartisan i should point out  paul wellstone said  `` mike  this may not be the lead story on the network news  but it 's a good piece of work.,Democratic
'' well  indeed it was not the lead story on the network news .,Democratic
david broder reports  it was hard to find a trace of their bill .,Democratic
the news at that time was overwhelmed  overtaken by scandals .,Democratic
but as says broder  in communities less consumed by scandal than washington  the impact of the measure that dewine and wellstone and others had fashioned may be felt in real lives long after the memories of the scandals have faded .,Democratic
in a dynamic economy where technological changes and market shifts are forcing layoffs of some people even as other jobs are being created  the key is to equip workers with needed skills and then link them efficiently to the vacancies .,Democratic
that is what this legislation is intended to do .,Democratic
it should be authorized at a greater amount .,Democratic
said broder back then  the workers will never know the names of the legislators  but they are in their debt .,Democratic
unfortunately  the workers who do not get to take advantage of this program because it is underfunded will never know what they have missed  and we have let them down .,Democratic
we should oppose this rule  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this legislation .,Democratic
today republicans are bringing to the floor as their first major legislative action a payback to big business at the expense of consumers .,Democratic
the republican agenda is to ensure that some americans do not get their day in court .,Democratic
make no mistake that this class action bill before us today is an extreme bill .,Democratic
it is not a compromise bill as some have claimed .,Democratic
it is an extreme bill that is an injustice to consumers and a windfall for irresponsible corporations .,Democratic
consumers will be hit hard by this bill  mr.,Democratic
speaker .,Democratic
it lumps together individual personal injury cases such as those involving vioxx  which are not class action under current procedures  and forces them into the federal courts .,Democratic
doing so will greatly increase the likelihood that such cases will never be heard .,Democratic
when americans are injured or even killed by vioxx or celebrex or discriminated against by walmart  they may never get their day in court .,Democratic
those cases that do go forward will take significantly longer because the federal courts are overburdened and unequipped for this caseload .,Democratic
that is why the bill is opposed by federal judges  including the judicial conference of the united states .,Democratic
special interests have even admitted that the real intent of this bill is to clog the federal courts and  therefore  stop the cases .,Democratic
to irresponsible corporations  however  the class action bill is a belated valentine .,Democratic
it is exactly what they have asked for .,Democratic
powerful corporations will largely be immune from the accountability that currently comes from meritorious state class action cases .,Democratic
for example  this bill would help shield large corporations from any accountability for enron-style shareholder fraud  for activities that violate employee rights under state law  and for telemarketing fraud targeted at the elderly .,Democratic
it should come as no surprise  however  that republicans are seeking yet another way to protect irresponsible corporations .,Democratic
the washington post reported that last year 's republican medical malpractice bill contained special liability protections that would have precluded consumers from suing to recover punitive damages arising for the types of injuries caused by vioxx and celebrex .,Democratic
protecting big drug companies is always at the top of the republican agenda .,Democratic
we saw that in the prescription drug bill under medicare .,Democratic
this is yet again another example of republicans being the handmaidens of the pharmaceutical industry .,Democratic
this bill also runs counter to the principles of federalism that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim to support .,Democratic
it throws thousands of state cases into federal courts that are not equipped to adjudicate state laws .,Democratic
for instance  lawsuits involving the enforcement of the state hourly wage laws  which often have greater protections than federal wage laws  would be forced into federal courts .,Democratic
in fact  46 state attorneys general on a bipartisan basis have requested an exemption so that they can continue to protect their citizens under the state consumer protection laws in state courts .,Democratic
the republicans have rejected that request while democrats have incorporated it into our substitute .,Democratic
democrats in our substitute support sensible approaches that weed out frivolous lawsuits but not meritorious claims .,Democratic
our democratic substitute says that certain kinds of cases must always have their day in court .,Democratic
physical injury cases  civil rights cases  wage and hour cases  state attorneys general cases  and others must be heard if we are to remain a nation that strives for justice for all .,Democratic
president harry truman said it so well .,Democratic
`` the democratic party stands for the people .,Democratic
the republican party stands  and has always stood  for special interest.,Democratic
'' i urge my colleagues to stand up to the special interests  to support the democratic substitute  to listen  to listen to the recommendation of the federal judges and the judicial conference of the united states and oppose this extreme legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to h.r.,Democratic
27  the reauthorization of the workforce investment act .,Democratic
the workforce investment act was one of these pieces of legislation that actually helps people .,Democratic
it was passed back in 1998 .,Democratic
unfortunately  this is a step backward as it comes before us today .,Democratic
the bill now here would create block grants to fund the adult dislocated worker and employment service programs .,Democratic
and as we know  funding through nearly every past block grant program has led to decreases in funding in just about every education or labor program that was block granted .,Democratic
in addition  the proposal here would reduce and restrict services for in-school youths .,Democratic
it would fund one-stop infrastructure by siphoning off funds used to serve veterans and individuals with disabilities ; and importantly  the legislation before us here would allow discrimination in hiring based on individuals 's religious beliefs .,Democratic
under current religious law  organizations are free to make employment decisions using religious criteria with their own money .,Democratic
why should we allow organizations to discriminate with taxpayer dollars ?,Democratic
it really would roll back 40 years of civil rights laws and decades of job training laws as we have heard here today .,Democratic
the workforce investment act was intended to be about helping hard working americans find jobs and help those who have a job receive training to improve their employment prospects .,Democratic
this is  i repeat  the kind of legislation that could actually help people .,Democratic
these one-stop centers have been a success .,Democratic
but this legislation does not provide adequate authorized funding for them and it changes many of the good features that have been part of the workforce investment act .,Democratic
we could be closing the skills gap  but unfortunately  the bill does not do that .,Democratic
it is a step backward from the legislation that was passed in 1998 .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from ohio .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime  mr.,Democratic
scott xz4003641 along with ms.,Democratic
woolsey  mr.,Democratic
van hollen  mr.,Democratic
frank  mr.,Democratic
edwards  and mr.,Democratic
nadler  to the base bill  h.r.,Democratic
27 .,Democratic
as i stated with respect to the rule  h. res.,Democratic
126  the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r.,Democratic
1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the deficiencies that lie within the provisions on the floor .,Democratic
the need for debate arises from disagreement .,Democratic
as representatives of the united states congress  we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents .,Democratic
a restricted rule precludes that opportunity .,Democratic
i support the scott-woolsey-vanhollen-frank-edwards-nadler amendment to h.r.,Democratic
27 to remove the provision allowing religious discrimination in employment from the underlying bill .,Democratic
a base bill purportedly designed to improve the opportunity to achieve adequate employment is no place to encourage discrimination .,Democratic
in fact  there is no place for religious discrimination in american law just as there should be no place in america for that kind of backwards thinking .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27  in its current state  erodes fundamental civil rights protections for the unemployed and the underemployed by exempting faith-based organizations from compliance with the current non-discrimination law .,Democratic
presently  under our country 's existing laws  in title vii of the civil rights act  employing institutions using private funds were exempt from employment discrimination protections .,Democratic
however  wia programs are federally funded and as such do not fall under the jurisdiction of the title vii statute .,Democratic
simply put : public funds are not allowed to be used to encourage religious discrimination in employment and that should not change .,Democratic
each of my colleagues should understand that without this important amendment  we are advocating the notion that one 's ability to provide employment to those who are in need is contingent on the religious institution to which the individual belongs .,Democratic
what if anything is accomplished by attempting to create religious hierarchies in the workplace ?,Democratic
what benefit does that provide the employer ?,Democratic
none .,Democratic
and thus the language allowing religious discrimination should be stricken from the bill .,Democratic
as should all language that does not add to the well being of job-seekers or employment services .,Democratic
the founding fathers of this country found it necessary to say that no one should be unfairly judged or discriminated against on the basis of their religion .,Democratic
this congress should do no less .,Democratic
we should not create law that does harm .,Democratic
we should not encourage discrimination of any kind  religious or otherwise .,Democratic
surely  this country prides itself on its diversity and its willingness to open its doors to people of different religions  races  and ethnic backgrounds .,Democratic
yet on the floor of the people 's house we are faced with an attempt by the republicans to create a monolithic sub-culture within our employment training programs .,Democratic
despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle  h.r.,Democratic
27 as it currently reads will not only result in the loss of jobs for applicants who do not identify with their prospective employer 's religious beliefs but more importantly it will cause the loss of quality workers .,Democratic
the scott-woolsey-van hollen-frank-edwards-nadler amendment will effectively retain civil rights protections for individuals who seek employment or employment training .,Democratic
this amendment simply retains their freedom of religious choice and their freedom not to be discriminated against due to their religion .,Democratic
this amendment adds nothing to the law rather it maintains current law .,Democratic
without the addition of this proposal  however  the body elected to serve all of the people of this country will have endorsed employment discrimination with federal dollars .,Democratic
we simply can not allow this to happen .,Democratic
we must do everything we can to preserve the fundamentals of head start .,Democratic
i urge my colleagues to vote to ensure that our job programs are not muddied and degraded by the promotion of religious discrimination .,Democratic
therefore  i stand in full support of this amendment and i urge my colleagues to do the same .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr.,Democratic
mcdermott ) xz4002620 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise in strong opposition to this bill .,Democratic
this bill is nearly identical to the wia bill that passed this house last congress on a near party-line vote .,Democratic
it was a bad bill then  and it remains a bad bill now .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 represents a missed opportunity to ensure that more  not less  job training happens for the millions who are unemployed or looking to upgrade their skills .,Democratic
this legislation fails to increase the amount of actual training services that will be provided to unemployed  dislocated  and underemployed workers .,Democratic
instead  this legislation focuses on moving around and changing the bureaucratic elements of wia without focusing on getting more resources to the consumers of these programs .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 is largely the same proposal backed by the administration for the past 2 years .,Democratic
just a few weeks ago  president bush spoke to individuals in omaha  nebraska .,Democratic
there he met a woman in her late 50s who is a mother of three children .,Democratic
she told him that presently she was working three jobs to ensure she could provide for her family .,Democratic
the president 's response was the following  and i quote exactly : `` uniquely american  is n't it ?,Democratic
i mean  that is fantastic that you 're doing that.,Democratic
'' what insensitivity .,Democratic
is this the attitude of this administration when it comes to the challenges of working adults and families ?,Democratic
i think this quote from the president speaks for itself .,Democratic
it will go down in history with marie antoinette 's famous quote : `` let them eat cake.,Democratic
'' mr.,Democratic
chairman  this bill is not going to help this mother of three or the millions of americans seeking job training .,Democratic
this bill is objectionable for four primary reasons .,Democratic
first  the bill block-grants the adult worker  dislocated worker  and employment service program .,Democratic
this effectively repeals the wagner-peyser act and the employment service  the national program used to match job seekers with employment opportunities .,Democratic
termination of the employment service will translate into higher unemployment and less jobs .,Democratic
the elimination of the employment service and wagner-peyser marks another example of the republican majority terminating a new deal program .,Democratic
wagner-peyser was first enacted in june of 1933 in the first term of president franklin delano roosevelt .,Democratic
it is shameful that we are eliminating a 70-year-old program that has helped so many achieve and maintain work .,Democratic
in my hometown of flint  michigan  we had two parts of the unemployment office  one where you applied for the unemployment benefits and the other where you went in and were seeking a job and they would put the unemployed and an employer together .,Democratic
that would be decimated by this bill .,Democratic
second  h.r.,Democratic
27 allows governors to siphon off resources currently providing veterans  adult learners  and individuals with disabilities with critical services .,Democratic
instead of helping vulnerable and needy individuals  these resources would fund infrastructure costs of the one-stop centers .,Democratic
many of these individuals have nowhere else to turn to receive help  and this bill would exacerbate this problem .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 requires programs which provide these critical services to give up resources  but it also takes away any say over how they are allocated or used .,Democratic
they no longer will have a voice on the local boards .,Democratic
we should not be taking funds from these programs .,Democratic
these lost resources will translate into disruptions and lost opportunities to people who presently rely on these services .,Democratic
we should provide a separate source of funding for these one-stop centers .,Democratic
third  the bill allows discrimination in hiring based on religion with wia funds .,Democratic
the bill turns back the clock on decades of civil rights protections in our job training programs .,Democratic
this is simply wrong .,Democratic
focus hope in detroit  michigan  is one of the best  if not the best  job training program in the state of michigan .,Democratic
focus hope was run until his death by father william cunningham  a classmate of mine in the seminary .,Democratic
he trained thousands of people in inner-city detroit as a catholic priest assigned by his bishop there  and he did not care whether those who were training people to run a lathe  to do engineering or whatever it was  he did not care whether they were catholic  whether they were protestant  whether they were morman  muslim or had no faith at all .,Democratic
all he cared was they knew how finally  mr.,Democratic
chairman  h.r.,Democratic
27 creates personal reemployment accounts which voucherize the job training system and cuts individuals off from other training services .,Democratic
the money they do not spend to get a job  they can keep and use for any purpose .,Democratic
workers do not need a bribe to get back to work .,Democratic
research on similar schemes have proven that pras are not an effective means of providing job training .,Democratic
mr. chairman  this bill does not respond to the needs of underemployed and unemployed individuals .,Democratic
it misses an opportunity to improve our job training system .,Democratic
i urge members to join me in opposing passage of this legislation .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the structured rule that has been reported out of the committee on rules for this debate .,Democratic
the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r.,Democratic
1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the issues .,Democratic
the need for debate arises from disagreement .,Democratic
as representatives of the united states congress  we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents .,Democratic
a restricted rule precludes that opportunity .,Democratic
nevertheless  i am pleased that the amendments of my colleagues from massachusetts  new york  and virginia respectively have been ruled in order .,Democratic
passage of these three important amendments will bring h.r.,Democratic
27 one step closer to providing more jobs and better opportunities for american workers to receive training for these jobs .,Democratic
without them and many other suggestions that have been made by our colleagues  this bill fails as to both initiatives .,Democratic
in the short term  extending unemployment benefits  coupled with the assistance that unemployed workers can receive through one-stop service centers  will provide workers with the means to achieve high paying jobs .,Democratic
we must address the needs of our unemployed now and in a manner that respects the rights of individuals regardless of their faith  while they are struggling to pay their mortgages and to put food on the table for their families .,Democratic
the base bill will fail to address these concerns and squander resources better used to provide immediate help to our unemployed workers .,Democratic
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to reject a restrictive rule or to support the amendments offered by mr.,Democratic
tierney  ms.,Democratic
velazquez  and mr.,Democratic
scott .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr.,Democratic
andrews ) xz4000080 .,Democratic
i yield to the gentleman from ohio .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise to support the tierney amendment  and i thank the distinguished gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
kildee ) xz4002160 for yielding me this time and also for his leadership .,Democratic
i also want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Democratic
tierney ) xz4004070 for his leadership .,Democratic
i know he was very thoughtful in this amendment .,Democratic
particularly when we talk about these programs  what comes to mind  and i heard the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Democratic
kildee ) xz4002160 be so eloquent in the committee on rules about the effectiveness and the importance of a training program  number one  for the new jobs of the 21st century .,Democratic
i am reminded of the fact that i spent a good part of my time as a locally elected official on the houston city council promoting the job training programs of our community that came down through the workforce board commissions in texas .,Democratic
when you eliminate summer jobs  you are literally undermining the opportunities for inner-city and rural youth to move to the next level of opportunity .,Democratic
you are extinguishing the right and the exposure that they have for career preparation .,Democratic
you go into these youth training programs and you look at the smiles on the faces of individuals who have come from experiences where there was no work  where their families are unemployed  and where there is no hope and opportunity .,Democratic
i am very disappointed  in addition  to the cut in youth programs  and the fact that we are now getting rid of the veterans ' preference for job training  actually cutting funds .,Democratic
what an outrage .,Democratic
with a million people having served in afghanistan and iraq ; with the devastation of the impact of those returning veterans  with their emotional problems and injuries  and now we are suggesting to them that they are not worthy of a job preference .,Democratic
let me also say that when you block-grant these dollars  you block-grant job training away .,Democratic
that is what this program does ; and in particular  it sends away this opportunity .,Democratic
my last point is that i might beg to differ with the chairman of this particular distinguished committee .,Democratic
there is discrimination in this bill .,Democratic
and  frankly  i think we should follow the kildee model  who said that he knew a priest in detroit who had a job training program who made sure that there was no discrimination  whether someone is a muslim  whether they are jewish or catholic or protestant .,Democratic
a program that is based upon religion and allows someone to deny you the opportunity for a job or a training position under the auspices of being a particular faith and being in charge of that particular program is discrimination under title vii in the 1964 civil rights bill or under any discrimination law that has been passed in america and that exists today .,Democratic
frankly  i believe this bill  even in its presence on the floor of the house  should go no further than this house ; and i ask my colleagues to support the tierney amendment  but to oppose the underlying bill .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from washington  d.c .,Democratic
( ms.,Democratic
norton ) .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Democratic
woolsey ) xz4004360 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield two minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr.,Democratic
holt ) xz4001840 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Democratic
mccarthy ) xz4002570 .,Democratic
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Democratic
hinojosa ) xz4001790 .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i rise today to voice my opposition to this job training improvement act because it does nothing to improve job training in our country .,Democratic
congress has an opportunity to take the reauthorization of the workforce investment act and address the needs of millions of unemployed americans .,Democratic
instead  we are presented with a proposal that reduces the impact of job training programs by cutting funding to traditional job training providers such as the veteran 's employment programs and perkins vocational education programs .,Democratic
this bill also consolidates the adult  dislocated worker and employment service programs and their funding while repealing the wagner peyser act .,Democratic
wager peyser established the federal performance and accountability standards that ensure our job training programs are quality programs that place able workers in appropriate positions in the workforce .,Democratic
furthermore  this bill would allow federally funded job training organizations to question a candidate about their religious beliefs .,Democratic
i 've been a christian all my life .,Democratic
however  i do not feel it is the place of the federal government or anyone receiving federal funds to question a job candidate about their religious beliefs .,Democratic
at this time  congress needs to place more resources into workforce training  not reduce job training programs that are successful .,Democratic
the houston area continues to have an unemployment rate higher than the national average  as does the state of texas .,Democratic
this bill will slow down the ability of those who need workforce training from getting it  and right now this economy needs all the help it can get .,Democratic
h.r.,Democratic
27 is bad public policy and will further slow our efforts to strengthen our economy .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Democratic
in summary  i urge a no vote on this bill .,Democratic
in 1998  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Democratic
mckeon ) xz4002670 who is a very good friend of mine  we will always remain friends  we have great respect for one another  we wrote a very good bill in 1998  wia  and i hope we would do likewise this time ; but i find myself unable to support this bill .,Democratic
the bill  among other things  i do not mean to be harsh  but among other things  encapsulates president bush 's response to the woman in omaha who told him that she was presently working three jobs to ensure that she could provide for her family .,Democratic
and the president responded  `` uniquely american  is n't it ?,Democratic
i mean  that is fantastic that you 're doing that.,Democratic
'' mr.,Democratic
chairman  we can do better than that .,Democratic
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Democratic
mr. chairman  how much time do i have remaining ?,Democratic
mr. speaker  i offer a privileged resolution ( h. res.,Republican
5 ) and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  let me respond by saying that the gentleman is absolutely right when he states that the chair does not rule on questions of constitutionality .,Republican
i would also like to say that on this question that is being brought forward by my friend  it is very clear to me based on statements that have been made by a wide range of constitutional scholars that what we are doing in the rules package that we are about to consider is in fact constitutional .,Republican
in fact  before the committee on rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following : `` it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act in precisely the moment of greatest peril .,Republican
no constitutional amendment is required to enact the proposed rule change because the constitution as drafted permits the congress to ensure the preservation of government.,Republican
'' let me further  mr.,Republican
speaker  say that the committee on rules intends to conduct further examination of the best way for the house to assure a continuity of government during a national emergency  and it is our hope that as we proceed with this work that further discussions will take place with the members of that very distinguished panel  the continuity commission  which included our former colleague  senator simpson  and speakers foley and gingrich and former minority leader bob michel  leon panetta  kwasi mfume  and i believe we will have a chance to proceed with this ; but i think it would be very appropriate for us to proceed with consideration of the rules package that we have .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
delay ) xz4001040 for his fine statement and for yielding me the time to discuss this opening-day rules package .,Republican
mr. speaker  the house is an institution built upon its rules .,Republican
accordingly  it is very appropriate that one of the first orders of business for this 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to the traditions and very forward thinking in its outlook for the work of this congress that lies ahead .,Republican
the package we have before us represents the work product of many members .,Republican
during the initial stages of compiling this rules package back in november  the committee on rules received 40 different proposals from both democrats and republicans .,Republican
in addition to that  our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house  its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house .,Republican
all of the ideas contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities .,Republican
mr. speaker  i include for the record at this point detail on each of these changes in a section-by-section analysis .,Republican
section-by-section summary of h. res.,Republican
5  adopting house rules for the 109th congress the rules of the house of representatives for the 108th congress are adopted as the rules of the house for the 99th congress with amendments as provided in section 2 and with other orders as provided in section 3. ( a ) committee on homeland security .,Republican
creates a standing committee on homeland security  and grants it legislative and oversight jurisdiction .,Republican
first  the committee 's jurisdiction includes overall homeland security policy so that it can focus on national policies affecting the federal government .,Republican
second  the jurisdiction includes authority over the department of homeland security ( dhs ) 's internal administration .,Republican
third  the committee would have jurisdiction over functions of the dhs relating to six specified areas .,Republican
these include : ( a ) border and port security ( except immigration policy and non-border enforcement ) ; ( b ) customs ( except customs revenue ) ; ( c ) integration  analysis and dissemination of homeland security information ; ( d ) domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism ; ( e ) research and development ; and ( f ) transportation security .,Republican
additionally  the committee would have broad oversight authority over government-wide homeland security matters .,Republican
finally  changes are made to the ( b ) general oversight responsibilities -- insuring against duplicative programs .,Republican
adds to the required list of content included in each standing committee 's adopted oversight plan as submitted to the committees on government reform and house administration a review of federal programs with a view to insuring against duplication of such programs .,Republican
[ rule x  clause 2 ( d ) ( 1 ) ] ( c ) ( 1 ) membership of budget committee .,Republican
permits one member of the budget committee majority and one member of the minority to be `` designated '' by the respective elected leaderships .,Republican
current rules require such members to be `` from '' elected leadership .,Republican
[ rule x  clause 5 ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ( c ) ( 2 ) rules committee organization .,Republican
authorizes the chairman of the committee on rules to serve as chairman  notwithstanding the prohibition on serving more than three consecutive terms .,Republican
[ rule x  clause 5 ( c ) ( 2 ) ] ( d ) ( 1 ) privileged motions in committee -- recess subject to the call of the chair .,Republican
allows for a privileged motion in committee to recess subject to the call of the chair for a period less than 24 hours .,Republican
currently only a motion to recess from day to day is privileged .,Republican
[ rule xi  clause 1 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ] ( d ) ( 2 ) motion to go to conference .,Republican
allows committees to adopt a rule directing the chairman of the committee to offer a privileged motion to go to conference at any time the chairman deems it appropriate during a congress .,Republican
currently a motion to request or agree to a conference with the senate is privileged if the committee authorizes the chairman to make such a motion .,Republican
[ rule xi  clause 2 ( a ) ] ( e ) motion to suspend the rules .,Republican
extends suspension authority beyond monday or tuesday to include wednesday .,Republican
[ rule xv  clause 1 ( a ) ] ( f ) repeal of corrections calendar .,Republican
removes corrections calendar from the standing rules of the house .,Republican
[ rule xv  clause 6 ] ( g ) allows references to the senate .,Republican
allows remarks in debate to include references to the senate or its members .,Republican
remarks are to be confined to the question under debate  avoiding personality .,Republican
[ rule xvii  clause 1 ] ( h ) provisional quorum .,Republican
provides for continuity of legislative operations in the house in the event of catastrophic circumstances .,Republican
the rule allows for the house to conduct business with a provisional quorum only after a motion to compel members attendance  as prescribed under clause 5 ( a ) of rule xx  has been disposed of and the following occur in sequence without the house adjourning : ( a ) a call of the house or a series of calls of the house totaling 72 hours without producing a quorum ; ( b ) the speaker  with the minority and majority leaders  receive from the sergeant-at-arms ( or his designee ) a catastrophic quorum failure report and shall consult with the minority and majority leaders on the contents of such report and shall announce the contents of such report to the house ; and ( c ) a further call of the house or series of calls are conducted for a total of 24 hours without producing a quorum .,Republican
a catastrophic quorum failure report is defined as a report advising that the inability of the house to establish a quorum is attributable to catastrophic circumstances involving natural disaster  attack  contagion  or similar calamity rendering ( i ) postponement of certain votes .,Republican
adds the motion to reconsider  tabling motions to reconsider and amendments reported from the committee of the whole among those votes the speaker may postpone to a designated place in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days .,Republican
[ rule xx  clause ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ( j ) ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) allowing the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses .,Republican
allows members to use campaign funds to pay certain  limited types of official expenses ( e.g.  handheld communication devices ) .,Republican
this change conforms house rules to current law ( sec .,Republican
105  p.l .,Republican
108-83 )  and mirrors rules that took effect in the senate in 2002 .,Republican
[ rule xxiv and rule xxiii  clause 6 ( c ) ] ( j ) ( 3 ) use of frank for mass mailings before an election .,Republican
amends the rule to conform to section 3210 of title 39 united states code  stating that a mass mailing is not frankable when it is postmarked less than 90 days before the date of a primary or general election which he is a candidate for public office .,Republican
currently the rules states 60 days .,Republican
[ rule xxiv  clause 8 ] ( j ) ( 4 ) gift rule on officially connected travel .,Republican
expands the category of individuals who may accompany a member or staff person on such a trip at the sponsor 's expense to include a relative of the member or the staff person .,Republican
under a provision of the current gift rule ( clause 5 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( d ) of the house rule xxv )  a member or staff person may be accompanied on a privately funded  officially connected trip  at the sponsor 's expense  only by either his or her `` spouse or a child ''  and not by any other relative .,Republican
[ rule xxv  clause 5 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( d ) ] ( k ) ( 1 ) due process for members .,Republican
affords members the opportunity to be heard in the event the standards committee alleges the member has violated or may have violated the code of conduct .,Republican
members may opt for either an adjudicatory proceeding or they can submit a response to the committee report/letter with their response being made public with committee report/letter .,Republican
under the current rule  the chairman and ranking member  or the committee  may take action against a member without a complaint  notice  or the opportunity to be heard .,Republican
[ rule xi  clause 3 ] ( k ) ( 2 ) restore presumption of innocence .,Republican
provides that no action will be taken on a complaint unless the chairman and ranking minority member of the standards committee  or the committee itself  find within 45 days that further investigation is merited by the facts of the complaint  maintaining the presumption of innocence .,Republican
currently  if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days  the matter automatically goes to an investigative committee .,Republican
( k ) ( 3 ) right to counsel .,Republican
provides that members may select a counsel of their choice even if that counsel represents other members .,Republican
[ rule xi  clause 3 ] ( 1 ) technical and codifying changes .,Republican
technical and grammatical changes are made throughout the rules of the house .,Republican
( a ) ( 1 ) - ( a ) ( 3 ) continuation of budget enforcement mechanisms from the 108th .,Republican
clarifies that section 306 of the budget act ( prohibiting consideration of legislation within the budget committee 's jurisdiction  unless reported by the budget committee ) only applies to bills and joint resolutions and not to simple or concurrent resolutions .,Republican
it also makes a section 303 point of order ( requiring adoption of budget resolution before consideration of budget-related legislation ) applicable to text made in order as an original bill by a special rule .,Republican
specified or minimum levels of compensation for federal office will not be considered as providing new entitlement authority .,Republican
( a ) ( 4 ) continuation of budget `` deeming '' resolution from the 2nd session of the 108th congress .,Republican
establishes that the provisions of the senate concurrent resolution 95 of the 108th congress  shall have effect in the 109th congress until such time as a budget resolution for the fiscal year 2005 is adopted .,Republican
( b ) extra subcommittees for armed services  international relations  and transportation & amp ; infrastructure .,Republican
a waiver of rule x  clause 5 ( d )  is granted for armed services and transportation & amp ; infrastructure for 6 subcommittees  and international relations for 7 subcommittees in the 109th congress .,Republican
( c ) numbering of bills .,Republican
in the 109th congress  the first 10 numbers for bills ( h.r.,Republican
1 through h.r.,Republican
10 ) shall be reserved for assignment by the speaker to such bills as he may designate when introduced .,Republican
the gentlewoman from virginia ( mrs.,Republican
jo ann davis ) xz4000950 is the author of one important provision directing committees to review matters within their jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative government programs as part of their oversight planning at the beginning of each congress .,Republican
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after the very successful experiment we had with suspensions on wednesday in the 108th congress .,Republican
the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated .,Republican
we discussed that earlier  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
the provisional quorum language includes a number of safeguards to ensure that this institution can continue to operate during times of turmoil and to ensure that democracy will be preserved .,Republican
we are living in a post-9/11 world and it is very important that we continue to expend a lot of time and energy dealing with the institutional challenges as well as the challenges that our nation faces under these circumstances .,Republican
i would like to say  also  mr.,Republican
speaker  that we will eliminate the corrections calendar .,Republican
this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors that are in law but it turned out to after a while become more cumbersome than other procedures that we already have to deal with that  such as the suspension calendar .,Republican
and  yes  mr.,Republican
speaker  in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members  so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and that they avoid personality .,Republican
the senate has long had a similar provision and this new rule merely conforms our rules to theirs .,Republican
i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings  and i believe that we can do that even with the rules change that i have just discussed .,Republican
on another topic  the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules .,Republican
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and the ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct  number one  clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor 's expense and  two  conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses  such as cell phones .,Republican
by the way  we also have included a provision suggested by the distinguished gentleman from connecticut ( mr.,Republican
larson ) xz4002330 to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90-day preelection limit on franked mail .,Republican
the package also includes two other provisions addressing our ethics rules .,Republican
the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case .,Republican
the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do not act within 45 days .,Republican
this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process .,Republican
let me say that we are going to be hearing from the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct in just a few minutes  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
as important as each of those changes are  perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be  as the speaker said in his very thoughtful opening statement here today  the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security .,Republican
it represents a far-reaching and critically important part of our overall strategic effort to protect the american people .,Republican
the 9/11 commission unanimously called for this action .,Republican
they saw the need  and we believe most members do as well .,Republican
over the past 3 years  the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways .,Republican
we have mandated change at the federal  state and local levels .,Republican
we have asked for change from our allies and forced change upon our enemies .,Republican
and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago  and we responded here  first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security .,Republican
their final report  a thorough and complete study of homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules  was transmitted to the committee on rules at the end of last year .,Republican
this change in house rule x  which governs the committees and their legislative jurisdictions  is a delicately crafted architecture .,Republican
it creates with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will be placing in the record  the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security .,Republican
at the same time  the american people will live with the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks .,Republican
mr. speaker  the new committee will have jurisdiction over  first  overall homeland security policy ; second  the organization and administration of the department of homeland security ; and  third  functions of the department of homeland security relating to border and port security  except immigration policy and nonborder enforcement ; customs  except customs revenue ; the integration  analysis and dissemination of homeland security information  domestic preparedness for  and collective response to  terrorism  research and development  and transportation security as well .,Republican
by approving this resolution  mr.,Republican
speaker  the house will do what the speaker and the 9/11 commission as well as the president has asked us to do  consolidate jurisdiction of the house into one committee .,Republican
this committee will be dedicated to setting national homeland security policy and to effectively overseeing that the department of homeland security carries out its mission .,Republican
finally  mr.,Republican
speaker  as we discuss this resolution  i will look forward to questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional matters  but i will say that clearly the issue of referral lies solely in the hands of the speaker .,Republican
i will in no way be responding in a manner which would infringe on that power of the speaker .,Republican
once again i want to say on all of these issues  and especially the last one  which was a great challenge in trying to fashion a new committee on homeland security with jurisdiction that emerged from many other committees was not an easy task .,Republican
i want to congratulate speaker hastert for the leadership that he has shown on this and i want to thank all of the committee chairmen who were involved in this process .,Republican
i believe that with the passage of this house rules package  we will be able to create a stronger and a safer america  which is a priority for every single one of us who has taken the oath of office today .,Republican
i urge support of this package of rules .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of this balanced rules package .,Republican
i want to speak particularly to the provisions regarding homeland security .,Republican
to determine whether a proposed regime to oversee homeland security is appropriate  one can not just look at a flow chart .,Republican
the simplest structure is not necessarily the best  nor is one that is unduly complex .,Republican
one has to look at how a proposed structure will actually function and what it can and can not accomplish .,Republican
the homeland jurisdiction being proposed in this package strikes the right balance between a system that is too centralized and one that is too diffuse .,Republican
first  i should say that the most important and necessary change regarding governance of the department of homeland security was made 2 years ago when we created a subcommittee on homeland security on the committee on appropriations .,Republican
but having a single committee that can look across the department of homeland security from an authorizing perspective is also a sensible move  and the new committee created in this package will do that .,Republican
what would not make sense  however  simple as it might seem  is giving sole authority over all aspects of homeland security to the new committee .,Republican
homeland security is too diffuse and important a government activity to rest with one committee .,Republican
almost every activity of every federal agency has some relationship to homeland security  and almost every activity of the department of homeland security impinges on the activities of other agencies .,Republican
an appropriate congressional oversight structure has to take account of that basic fact .,Republican
a structure that overly centralized homeland security oversight would make it harder to evaluate the department of homeland security in the context of the other activities of the federal government .,Republican
an overcentralized structure could also make a congressional committee a captive of the agency that it oversees .,Republican
i know that it is very easy to denigrate arguments against a single  centralized select committee on homeland security as so much turf fighting .,Republican
but in reality it is simply intellectually lazy to assume that a centralized structure would enable congress to do its work more effectively .,Republican
i found especially ironic a washington post editorial that called for a highly centralized structure .,Republican
the editorial argued that a centralized committee would be more efficient because the department of homeland security would not have to answer questions from a lot of different committees .,Republican
well  it would also be more efficient if the department did not have to respond to questions from a lot of different news outlets  but presumably the post would argue that there are advantages to forcing the department to respond to reporters with a variety of areas of expertise and a variety of perspectives .,Republican
the post certainly would not want the only news outlet to be an in-house publication .,Republican
so i want to applaud the house leadership for doing what it has done  and i stand in strong support of this rules package .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
let me say after having heard from two of my committee on rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them in a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations in consideration of measures of this house .,Republican
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr.,Republican
taylor ) xz4003991 for purposes of a colloquy .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i would like to respond to my very good friend from maryland by saying that i may not be as eloquent today as i was when i was in the minority  but i continue to share my very strong commitment to ensure the integrity and the behavior of members of this institution .,Republican
i also will say as my friend said  it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Republican
hefley )  chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct  has made it clear that he is supportive of this package .,Republican
i and my colleagues looked at these recommendations  all of which emerged from members and former members of the committee on standards of official conduct .,Republican
i also believe that it is very possible for us to maintain the highest ethical standards and to continue to ensure  to now ensure that due process is entitled to members of this institution as they proceed with matters before that committee .,Republican
so i believe that this package is one which should enjoy strong bipartisan support  because when it comes to matters of ethics it will address the concern and the protection of members of both the minority and the majority  as well as this institution as a whole .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i will be happy to respond to the gentleman .,Republican
let me say we are in the midst of a discussion about ethics at this point .,Republican
obviously  it is our goal to maintain the highest ethical standards .,Republican
we have a law  which is actually a criminal law  which states that it is a violation of 18 u.s. code 607 for the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property .,Republican
the idea behind this change that is included in this rules package is that members should not be required to carry two separate cell phones with them .,Republican
this would allow campaign funds to be used for the purchase of a cell phone that might be used for calling your office or other official purposes .,Republican
but the law which prevents the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property in fact is maintained and is one we that feel very strongly about .,Republican
it is a violation of the law .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this rules package .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time  and i move the previous question on the resolution .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  we have a great rules package that is coming before us  a rules package which i believe is deserving of bipartisan support .,Republican
the reason i say it is deserving of bipartisan support is that is the word that has been used by members on both sides of the aisle to describe exactly what we have been doing here and should be doing here .,Republican
mr. speaker  this package includes a number of very important provisions .,Republican
it allows us to deal with the prospect of a horrendous attack on this institution  and it allows us to continue this institution 's operations so the american people will understand that this institution stands even at a time of great crisis .,Republican
this rules package allows for the establishment of a new permanent standing committee on homeland security  as the speaker outlined in his opening remarks here today .,Republican
i believe that is something that will allow democrats and republicans to spend time working on that issue .,Republican
mr. speaker  this is a rules package which allows for bipartisan process at the ethics committee level .,Republican
the committee on standards of official conduct is the committee which has the responsibility of working to ensure the integrity of all of the members of this institution .,Republican
the package we have before us does just that .,Republican
i believe that the statement made by the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct  the gentleman from colorado ( mr.,Republican
hefley )  is very clear .,Republican
he understands that the provisions included in this package will in fact maintain the integrity of this institution .,Republican
he was not going to support the earlier package ; he is supporting this package .,Republican
the issue of bipartisanship is important because in this package we ensure that we will not see the politicization of the ethics process which tragically we have seen in the past  because it will require bipartisanship  which all members are talking about  if we do proceed with the investigatory process .,Republican
that is the right thing to do  and i believe this package should in fact enjoy the support of democrats and republicans alike because it is designed to protect this institution and its members .,Republican
mr. speaker  the house is an institution built upon its rules .,Republican
accordingly  it is appropriate that one of the first orders of business of the 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to its traditions and forward-thinking in its outlook .,Republican
the package we have before us represents the work product of many members .,Republican
during the initial stages of compiling this package  back in november  the rules committee received 40 difference proposals form both democrats and republicans .,Republican
in addition  our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house  its committees  and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house .,Republican
while not every proposal we received was incorporated into this package  i assure you that each received substantial consideration by the speaker and the rules committee .,Republican
and  as always  the rules committee will continue to review our rules and operations to see where other improvements can be made .,Republican
mr. speaker  all of the ideals contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues  and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities .,Republican
while i will detail each of these changes in the section-by-section that i will place in the record  i want to elaborate on just a few of these changes .,Republican
the gentlewoman from virginia ( mrs.,Republican
jo ann davis ) is the author of one important provision directing committees to review matters within their jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative government programs as part of their oversight planning at the beginning of each congress .,Republican
there are a number of instances where we are conforming the rules to reflect current house practice  such as with the designation of leadership members of the budget committee and the taking of recesses in committee to allow flexibility on our schedules .,Republican
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after our successful experiment in the 108th congress .,Republican
the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated .,Republican
the `` provisional quorum '' language includes a number of safeguards to ensure that this institution can continue to operate during times of turmoil and democracy will be preserved .,Republican
as we search for permanent solutions to the problems facing us in the post-9/11 era  this is an important step in meeting our responsibilities .,Republican
we will also eliminate the corrections calendar .,Republican
while this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors in law  it turned out to be more cumbersome than other procedures  such as consideration under suspension of the rules .,Republican
and yes  mr.,Republican
speaker  in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues  the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members  so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and avoid personality .,Republican
the senate has long had similar provisions and this new rule merely conforms our rules to theirs .,Republican
i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings  and will do so even with this rules change .,Republican
on another topic  the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules .,Republican
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and ranking member of the standards committee : ( 1 ) clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor 's expense  and ( 2 ) conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses  such as a cellphone .,Republican
we also included provision suggested by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr.,Republican
larson ) to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90-day pre-election limit on franked mail .,Republican
the package also includes two other provisions addressing our ethics rules .,Republican
the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case .,Republican
the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do n't act within 45 days .,Republican
this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process .,Republican
as important as each of those changes are  mr.,Republican
speaker  perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security .,Republican
it represents a far-reaching and critically important part of our overall strategic effort to protect the american people .,Republican
the 9/11 commission unanimously called for this action .,Republican
they saw the need  and we believe most members do  too .,Republican
over the past 3 years  the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways .,Republican
we have mandated change at the federal  state  and local levels .,Republican
we have asked for change from our allies and forced change upon our enemies .,Republican
and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago  and we responded  first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002  and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security .,Republican
their final report  a thorough and complete study of homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules  was transmitted to my committee at the end of last year .,Republican
these measures made it clear to me and many other members that steps need to be taken to further ensure the safety of the american people .,Republican
the rules committee thoroughly reviewed the select committee 's report and recommended a comprehensive and thoughtful reform effort that mirrors the recommendations of the 9/11 commission : the formation of a permanent committee on homeland security .,Republican
this change in house rule x  which governs the committee and their legislative jurisdictions  is delicately crafted architecture .,Republican
it draws to the new committee only jurisdiction directly related to our defense against terrorism .,Republican
thus  it creates a primary committee while recognizing the other legitimate oversight roles of existing committees .,Republican
it acknowledges the expertise and experience residing in other committees and leaves with them jurisdiction that may have a homeland security implication but not a direct policy relationship .,Republican
the house must have one central point where we  as national legislators  sort out the critical questions of securing our homeland without sacrificing our free society or a stable economy .,Republican
however  we envision a system of `` purposeful redundancy.,Republican
'' by that we mean more than one level of oversight and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouraged .,Republican
with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will place in the record  the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security .,Republican
at the same time  the american people will live with the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks .,Republican
mr. speaker  the new committee will have jurisdiction over : ( 1 ) overall homeland security policy ; ( 2 ) the organization and administration of the department of homeland security ; and ( 3 ) functions of the department of homeland security relating to border and port security ( except immigration policy and non-border enforcement )  customs ( except customs revenue )  the integration  analysis  and dissemination of homeland security information  domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism  research and development  and transportation security .,Republican
by approving this resolution  the house will do what the speaker and the 9/11 commission has asked it to do : consolidate jurisdiction of the house in one committee .,Republican
this committee will be dedicated to setting national homeland security policy and to effectively overseeing that the department of homeland security carries out its mission .,Republican
mr. speaker  in making these changes  i want to note several points for the record .,Republican
first  referrals to the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress will not be considered a precedent for referrals in the 109th congress .,Republican
second  at the request of mr.,Republican
thomas  i am placing a document into the record regarding understandings between the department of treasury and the department of homeland security .,Republican
third  because the department continues to evolve  references to a department  agency  bureau  office  or subdivision include a reference to successor entities to the extent that the successor engages in homeland security activities now conducted by the department  agency  bureau  office  or subdivision referred to in the legislative history .,Republican
for example  the homeland security act of 2002 transferred the office of domestic preparedness to the department of homeland security  to `` have the primary responsibility within the executive branch of government for preparedness of the u.s. for acts of terrorism.,Republican
'' subsequently  its name has been changed by the department to `` office of state and local government coordination and preparedness ( slgcp ) '' although its mission stays the same .,Republican
finally  i welcome questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional matters related to this change .,Republican
however  i want to caution all members that referrals are solely within the speaker 's power  and  in my answers  i will not infringe upon the power .,Republican
once again  i appreciate the input from all of you regarding the 109th rules package  and i feel that with your assistance  we will make the rules of the house stronger and make for a safer country .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am very happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
boehlert ) xz4000350  the very distinguished chairman of the committee on science .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am inserting for the record the following legislative history regarding the changes made by this resolution to rule x  along with supporting materials .,Republican
legislative history to accompany changes to rule x rule x and the committee on homeland security & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; legislative history overall homeland security policy -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over `` overall homeland security policy '' is to be interpreted on a government-wide or multi-agency basis similar to the committee on government reform 's jurisdiction over `` overall economy  efficiency  and management of government operations and activities .,Republican
... .. '' surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of `` overall '' homeland security policy jurisdiction .,Republican
for example  the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over a bill coordinating the homeland security efforts by all of the critical infrastructure protection sectors .,Republican
jurisdiction over a bill addressing the protection of a particular sector would lie with the committee otherwise having jurisdiction over that sector .,Republican
organization and administration of the department of homeland security -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security would apply only to organizational or administrative aspects of the department where another committee 's jurisdiction did not clearly apply .,Republican
the committee 's jurisdiction is to be confined to organizational and administrative efforts and would not apply to programmatic efforts within the department of homeland security within the jurisdiction of other committees .,Republican
homeland security oversight -- this would vest the committee on homeland security with oversight jurisdiction over the homeland security community of the united states .,Republican
nothing in this clause shall be construed as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any other committee to study and review homeland security activities to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of that committee .,Republican
individual committee concerns agriculture -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over `` border and port security '' shall be limited to agricultural importation and entry inspection activities of the department of homeland security under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002 .,Republican
the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over animal and plant disease policy including the authority reserved to the department of agriculture to regulate policy under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002  and the animal health protection act  the plant protection act  the plant quarantine act  and the agriculture quarantine inspection user fee account .,Republican
the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over the agricultural research and diagnosis armed services -- the committee on armed services shall retain jurisdiction over warfighting  the military defense of the united states  and other military activities  including any military response to terrorism  pursuant to section 876 of the homeland security act of 2002 .,Republican
energy and commerce -- the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over measures that address the department of homeland security 's activities for domestic preparedness and collective response to terrorism .,Republican
the words `` to terrorism '' require a direct relation to terrorism .,Republican
the committee on homeland security 's jurisdiction over `` collective response to terrorism '' means that it shall receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security 's responsibilities for  and assistance to  first responders as a whole .,Republican
the committee on energy and commerce ( and other relevant committees ) shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addressing the separate entities that comprise the first responders .,Republican
for example  the committee on energy and commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over a bill directing the department of health and human services to train emergency medical personnel .,Republican
financial services -- the committee on financial services shall retain jurisdiction over the national flood insurance program and emergency food and shelter program of fema  and the defense production act .,Republican
the committee on financial services shall retain its jurisdiction over the anti-money laundering  terrorist financing  and anti-counterfeiting activities within the department of the treasury and the financial regulators .,Republican
government reform -- the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over `` the organization and administration of the department of homeland security.,Republican
'' the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over federal civil service  the overall economy  efficiency  and management of government operations and activities  including federal procurement  and federal paperwork reduction .,Republican
the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over government-wide information management efforts including the federal information security management act .,Republican
the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over intelligence -- the permanent select committee on intelligence shall retain jurisdiction over the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of all departments and agencies of the federal government  including the office of the director of national intelligence and the national counterterrorism center as defined in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 .,Republican
judiciary -- the committee on the judiciary shall retain jurisdiction over immigration policy and non-border enforceme4tn of the immigration laws .,Republican
its jurisdiction over immigration policy shall include matters such as the immigration and naturalization process  numbers of aliens ( including immigrants and non-immigrants ) allowed  classifications and lengths of allowable stay  the adjudication of immigration petitions and the requirements for the same  the domestic adjudication of immigration petitions and applications submitted to the department of labor or the department of homeland security and setting policy with regard to visa issuance and acceptance .,Republican
its jurisdiction over non-border enforcement shall be limited to those aspects of immigration enforcement not associated with the immediate entry of individuals into the country  including those aspects of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement .,Republican
the science -- the committee on science shall retain some jurisdiction over the research and development activities of the department of homeland security as such matters are incidental to the committee on science 's existing jurisdiction ( except where those activities are in the jurisdiction of another committee ) .,Republican
transportation and infrastructure -- the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain jurisdiction over the coast guard .,Republican
however  the committee on homeland security has jurisdiction over port security  and some coast guard responsibilities in that area will fall within the jurisdiction of both committees .,Republican
jurisdiction over emergency preparedness will be split between the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on homeland security .,Republican
the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction under clause 1 ( r ) ( 2 ) over `` federal management of emergencies and natural disasters.,Republican
'' this means that the committee retains its general jurisdiction over the emergency preparedness and response operations of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) .,Republican
bills addressing fema 's general preparation for disaster from any cause shall be referred as indicated earlier  the committee on homeland security 's jurisdiction over `` collective response to terrorism '' means that it would receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security 's responsibilities for  and assistance to  first responders as a whole and not over measures addressing first responder communities individually .,Republican
the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the functions of the department of homeland security relating to transportation security  while the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction over transportation safety .,Republican
in general  the committee on homeland security would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the transportation security administration and the committee on transportation and infrastructure would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the various entities within the department of transportation having responsibility for transportation safety  such as the federal aviation administration and the federal motor carrier safety administration .,Republican
the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security does not ways and means -- the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means over `` customs revenue '' is intended to include those functions contemplated in section 412 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the homeland security act of 2002 and includes those functions as carried out in collection districts and ports of entry and delivery .,Republican

mr. speaker  i am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2005 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 .,Republican
this report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 401 of the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 ( s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95  which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the house under h. res.,Republican

this status report is current through january 21  2005 .,Republican
the term `` current level '' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the president 's signature .,Republican
the first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority  outlays  and revenues with the aggregate levels set forth by s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95 .,Republican
this comparison is needed to enforce section 311 ( a ) of the budget act  which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution 's aggregate levels .,Republican
the table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2005 because appropriations for those years have not yet been considered .,Republican
the second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for discretionary action by each authorizing committee with the `` section 302 ( a ) '' allocations made under s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95 for fiscal year 2005 and fiscal years 2005 through 2009 .,Republican
`` discretionary action '' refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution .,Republican
this comparison is needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act  which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302 ( a ) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure .,Republican
it is also needed to implement section 311 ( b )  which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311 ( a ) .,Republican
the third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2005 with the `` section 302 ( b ) '' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among appropriations subcommittees .,Republican
the comparison is also needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302 ( b ) suballocation .,Republican
the fourth table gives the current level for 2006 of accounts for advance appropriations under section 401 s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican

this list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution  which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that are : ( i ) not identified in the statement of managers or ( ii ) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution .,Republican
enactment of measures providing new budget authority for fiscal year 2005 in excess of $ 46  377  000  000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fiscal year 2005 budget authority to exceed the appropriate level set by s. con .,Republican

dear mr .,Republican
chairman : the enclosed report shows the effects of congressional action on the fiscal year 2005 budget and is current through january 21  2004 .,Republican
this report is submitted under section 308 ( b ) and in aid of section 311 of the congressional budget act  as amended .,Republican
the estimates of budget authority  outlays  and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95  the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 .,Republican
the budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted by the committee on the budget to the house to reflect funding for wildland fire suppression and for technical reasons .,Republican
these revisions are authorized by sections 312 and 313 of s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95 .,Republican
in addition  under section 402 of s. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
95  amounts designated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the budget resolution .,Republican
as a result  the enclosed current level report excludes these amounts ( see footnote 2 of the report ) .,Republican
since my last letter  dated november 17  the congress has cleared and the president has signed the following acts that changed budget authority  outlays  or revenues for fiscal year 2005 : the second continuing resolution  2005 ( public law 108-416 ) ; the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act ( public law 108-429 ) ; the third continuing resolution  2005 ( public law 108-434 ) ; the consolidated appropriations act  2005 ( public law 108-447 ) ; an act to amend title xix of the social security act ( public law 108-448 ) ; the arizona water settlements act ( public law 108-451 ) ; the veterans ' benefits improvement act of 2004 ( public law 108-454 ) ; the thrift savings plan open elections act of 2004 ( public law 108-469 ) ; an act to authorize salary adjustments for justices and judges of the united states ( public law 108-491 ) ; an act to amend to internal revenue code of 1986 ( public law 108-493 ) ; an act to amend the national telecommunications and information administration organization act ( public law 108-494 ) ; the federal employee dental and visions benefits act of 2004 ( public law 108-496 ) ; and an act to accelerate the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of victims of the indian ocean tsunami ( public law 109-1 ) .,Republican
the effects of the actions listed above are detailed in the accompanying report .,Republican

had i been able to vote  i would have voted `` no .,Republican
'',Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  if the gentleman will yield further  i do not mean to reiterate or repeat too much .,Republican
looking at the history of these congressional gold medals  though  i think is very telling in terms of what we are doing because the history has always been to individuals for outstanding achievement .,Republican
so in terms of the groups  i really think we should honor that .,Republican
that is not disrespectful of any group that has gotten it or all the other groups who are potentially eligible out there if you use them in that criteria of measurement .,Republican
but the other issue is interesting  and that is how many of these should we be able to have ?,Republican
first of all  the history of the gold medal has been very bipartisan .,Republican
i think  as we all know  when we are dealing with that many signatures  it is going to be bipartisan .,Republican
there is no question about that .,Republican
but my sense is that the two a year is not as limiting as one might think when you really again look at the history of this .,Republican
in fact  if anything  it would be an expansion over what the total history of it has been .,Republican
by the time you go through a legislative session and you gather 290 signatures and you go through committee and you go to the floor  and i have handled these bills  they often happen the last day  by the way  so it is always very confusing in terms of what we are doing  i think you are going to find this is not as limiting as one might think .,Republican
again  i recognize the fact that it is a bigger country  that there is much more going on in the country and that kind of thing  but we are really trying to make sure that this is truly an honor for somebody who does something extraordinary in science or the arts  or an elected official or somebody of that nature  usually a president  i think the only elected official who has ever been honored ; people in religion  people who have just absolutely stood out in their circumstances .,Republican
my sense is while we can argue here on the floor that it is limiting  i think the bottom line is it is not going to end up being as limiting as one might think .,Republican
hopefully it would not be .,Republican
obviously if that happened to be the case  it is something that could always be revisited  but i just do not think it is going to be the case .,Republican
i believe that straightening this out is actually going to make these gold medals much more of a distinction than perhaps they would be if we allowed this to continue  particularly with the commemorative coin changes  increasing the pressure to try to do so many of these .,Republican
mr. chairman  i will be brief .,Republican
first of all  this is not a killer amendment .,Republican
this is not an unreasonable amendment  and the sponsor has certainly always been a very reasonable member of congress  and we are arguing at the margins here in terms of what we are doing  and i recognize that .,Republican
and i recognize these arguments because they are compelling to a degree .,Republican
having said all those things  i still oppose it .,Republican
and let me explain why .,Republican
it is not a lot different from what i have already said  mr.,Republican
chairman  and that is essentially we are trying to make this a medal of true distinction for true heroes of the united states of america .,Republican
i also believe  by the way  and the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
crowley ) xz4000870 said something i thought was interesting  and that is it is difficult to get the names on the legislation .,Republican
so the first year becomes a little more difficult  and that is true .,Republican
we sort of learn techniques in this when we have done it .,Republican
one is we take it to conferences or big gatherings of people and pass it out that way .,Republican
the gentleman from new jersey ( mr.,Republican
payne ) xz4003120 will always be a hero in my mind because he took it amongst the democrats and got a lot of signatures when i was struggling with it on a bill that i did last year  and i appreciate that a great deal .,Republican
but i have learned when one really applies oneself  they can do it reasonably rapidly ; and hopefully the committees will be able to be responsive to it and will be able to do two a year if that is what we decide to do .,Republican
but my judgment is four in total in the course of 2 years is sufficient .,Republican
and i am worried about the influx that is going on .,Republican
the chairman cited the numbers .,Republican
i do not remember the exact numbers .,Republican
it was something like 45 medals in the first 120 years and now 10 times that many in the last 10 years .,Republican
that means that this has increased  i think  at a rate that is too rapid  and again i do not in any way belittle anyone who has received this because they are all very distinguished people .,Republican
but having said that  we want this to be the highest honor possible .,Republican
so my judgment is we should defeat the amendment .,Republican
if at some point it proves we need to expand this  we would certainly consider that .,Republican
but i think we should try to restore this program to where it was before .,Republican
mr. chairman  i made a couple of these points before  and again i will not repeat too much here  but first and foremost is the 290 signatures .,Republican
i do not know if one party is ever going to have 290 members or not  i sort of doubt it  at least in the time most of us are around here  and you need both parties in order do this .,Republican
i learned with the coin that i did  which was benjamin franklin .,Republican
i can not tell you  and hardly anyone can tell you  whether benjamin franklin was or would have been a republican or a democrat in his history .,Republican
we do not know the politics of people like george washington  and certainly the people who have been from other countries  a number of individuals who received medals here in the congress of the united states .,Republican
in the history of the gold medals  as i believe the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
crowley ) xz4000870 pointed out  it has been as much democrats  even more so than republicans .,Republican
even on the business of the commemorative coins  a number of the sponsors in the senate have been democrats as well .,Republican
i just have never noticed a lot of politics in this  i guess is my point .,Republican
it seems to me i have been asked to sign these  and i generally sign them  unless it is something i think is spurious  by democrats and republicans .,Republican
i do not think about it .,Republican
certainly  if a party feels it is being slighted  they can say we are just not going to sign on to something .,Republican
i do not think this needs a political balance .,Republican
what it really needs  i think  is to find out  if we are going to do two  who the two most distinguished individuals are who should be recognized and go ahead and recognize them  apart from whatever the politics may be .,Republican
i do not think it is going to fall down along political lines .,Republican
so i do rise in opposition to this .,Republican
i just think it is sort of a necessary strain on having a political balance on something which is not essential .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
oxley ) xz4003070 for his support of the legislation as well as his managing of it here today  and his general goodwill for all people in this country .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
54  the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005  and i do urge its immediate adoption after consideration of the amendments today .,Republican
congress created the congress gold medal honor in 1776 to recognize military leaders  and awarded the first medal to george washington for his heroic service in the revolutionary war  as the chairman indicated earlier .,Republican
since then  the gold medal has evolved to become the highest civilian honor congress confers to express gratitude for distinguished service  to dramatize the virtues of patriotism  and to perpetuate the remembrance of a great event .,Republican
the legislation we consider today seeks to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded in any given year .,Republican
to understand the need for such legislation  a little history of the medal is in order .,Republican
as i mentioned  the first congressional gold medal was struck in 1776  in paris  for america had no appropriate facilities at that point  at the behest of the continental congress  which had not yet declared independence from great britain .,Republican
the recipient was general george washington  and the act that inspired the medal was his leadership of the continental army in driving the british from boston .,Republican
in the next dozen years  congress awarded six more gold medals to individuals for heroic action in the revolutionary war .,Republican
that is an average of one medal every congress .,Republican
by comparison  in the 108th congress we authorized five medal programs honoring seven individuals and one couple .,Republican
in the 106th congress we authorized seven medal programs  but because of multiple recipients  the number of medals totaled more than 300 .,Republican
mr. chairman  all of those medals were deserved  and i supported their authorization .,Republican
my concern  and a concern shared by many members  is that the luster and the importance and the meaning of a congressional gold medal will be tarnished if we do not limit the number we award .,Republican
reversing this trend will protect the medal 's prestige .,Republican
mr. chairman  this is a simple piece of legislation with great meaning .,Republican
it will ensure the future integrity and true honor of the award .,Republican
it is my goal that each recipient  president  civil rights leader  military hero  inventor  or noted healer  who receives the congressional gold medal will remain part of a unique honor bestowed by the united states congress .,Republican
as you may recall  mr.,Republican
chairman  we had a similar problem a decade ago with commemorative coins .,Republican
while commemorative coins are not as prestigious as congressional gold medals  both are used to recognize moments in history .,Republican
these coins have also helped raise money through surcharges for a worthy cause .,Republican
a decade ago  the commemorative coin program had gotten out of control  with many coin programs approved each year  and many of the programs costing taxpayers money .,Republican
one blatant example is the 1996 olympics coin program that the gao estimates cost taxpayers $ 26 million .,Republican
in response  mr.,Republican
chairman  i authored and congress approved the commemorative reform coin act .,Republican
now coin programs are limited to two a year and demand full cost recovery for taxpayers before any surcharges are paid .,Republican
additionally  before congress can consider a coin or medal program  two-thirds of the house  290 members  must cosponsor the legislation to demonstrate broad bipartisan support .,Republican
and having done that  i can tell you it takes broad bipartisan support to get the 290 members .,Republican
i believe that the reforms to the commemorative coin program have been extraordinarily successful .,Republican
since these reforms were enacted in the 104th congress  commemorative coins have not cost the taxpayers a dime .,Republican
instead  the programs have raised millions for worthy causes  provided valuable collections  and  importantly  restored prestige to commemorative coins .,Republican
but something disturbing happened when we reformed the commemorative coin program .,Republican
the number of congressional gold medals saw a dramatic increase .,Republican
from 1776  when congress created the medal  to 1904  congress approved 47 medals .,Republican
in the last 100 years  congress awarded 86 medals  including 20 in the past decade  since the commemorative coin reforms .,Republican
and this number jumped even higher  over 300  when including multiple recipients for each medal .,Republican
mr. chairman  over the years  congressional gold medals have gone to the reverend dr .,Republican
martin luther king  jr.  rosa parks  jackie robinson  mother teresa  elie wiesel  pope john paul ii  british prime ministers winston churchill and tony blair  jonas salk  john wayne  and robert f. kennedy  among others .,Republican
reading the list of all the medal recipients and the deeds that earned the medal is quite inspiring .,Republican
to maintain these medals as the highest of honors  the legislation before us would limit the number of medals that may be awarded to two a year  and clarify that recipients are individuals and not groups .,Republican
i understand there is concern by the minority that one bill per year should be designated for each party .,Republican
i feel it is important to note that proposals in the past have been sponsored in about equal numbers by republicans and democrats  and i do not really recall any discussion of the recipients ' or the sponsors ' party affiliations .,Republican
in my view  any such discussion would be inappropriate  as these awards should be awarded in true bipartisan fashion .,Republican
in practice  however  not through statute  the committee on financial services requires a two-thirds cosponsorship before considering proposals to award medals  a practice that the senate has now adopted .,Republican
i believe by the adoption of these simple changes  we can preserve the prestige and the integrity of the congressional gold medal program  something i believe all members support .,Republican
i encourage my colleagues to join me in maintaining the integrity of the congressional gold medal by supporting this measure .,Republican
i urge immediate and unanimous passage of h.r.,Republican
54 with no amendments but the manager 's amendment .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from new york .,Republican
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  and i will be glad to yield further in a moment  it typically has not worked that way .,Republican
typically  the way you do it is  somebody comes to you with the idea  maybe it is a thomas edison or somebody of that ilk  of that nature  and you generally will then go to your leadership or to the leadership on the other side or to the chairman of the committee and say  look  i am interested in getting this done .,Republican
if i am going to go out and get the 290 signatures  i want some idea that it is going to be considered .,Republican
i would be dumbfounded if you had five on one side and five on the other .,Republican
in fact  i would be dumbfounded if you had two on one side and two on the other .,Republican
you generally sort of pre-clear it ; and  generally speaking  politics has just not entered into it .,Republican
before you go through all that effort and work  you want to get a pretty good idea that the bill is going to be able to get at least through the house .,Republican
then  by the way  getting it through the senate is another whole other issue that you have to deal with as well .,Republican
so  typically  we have not had a surplus of these .,Republican
generally speaking  when we have gotten to the 290  it has already been pretty well agreed upon by leadership .,Republican
as the gentleman knows  on commemorative coins  they can be done in out years .,Republican
we are doing coins already for 2007 and years beyond that  i believe  at this point .,Republican
but almost always you work it out in advance .,Republican
as the gentleman knows from our committee work  i do not know of any time where we have actually had to pick and choose at the committee on these coins .,Republican
it is almost always worked out in advance and agreed upon .,Republican
mr. chairman  i truly do not worry about this from a political point of view .,Republican
i really do not think this is a necessary amendment to deal with that  based on what i have seen .,Republican
i do not think limiting it to two is going to change that at all .,Republican
i certainly would support the best people  which is what we are trying to do .,Republican
frankly  most of these bills  while there may be a democrat sponsor or a republican sponsor  almost always has a cosponsor from the other side .,Republican
you can not really do it without sponsors from both sides .,Republican
so there is much more bipartisanship in this process than almost anything i know about in this congress .,Republican
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  technically  as the gentleman and i both know  we have seen a lot  the majority is always going to control ultimately what is going to happen on the floor .,Republican
it will go through the committee and go to the floor .,Republican
i still go back to a whole history .,Republican
i have been here for 12 years .,Republican
i have watched these medals .,Republican
i have never seen a bit of politics in these medals .,Republican
i just have not seen it .,Republican
i do not think the limiting of the numbers is really going to alter that .,Republican
i think a large part now is because you need all those signatures  you just can not do it in a partisan sense .,Republican
so i do not think this amendment is necessary .,Republican
i think it brings in an element of politics that frankly we just do not have in the legislation .,Republican
so i will oppose it .,Republican
i understand the gentleman 's arguments  but i would oppose the amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purposes of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Republican
pelosi ) xz4003140 or her designee  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of the resolution  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of this rules package .,Republican
i am also rising in support of the historic legislative agenda it will govern  for today marks the beginning of what historians will likely look back upon as the most productive and significant congress in decades .,Republican
the mandate granted the majority  evidenced by our increased majorities in both houses of congress and the first presidential majority in 16 years  is clear .,Republican
the american people have entrusted the state of their security  prosperity and families to us ; and over the course of the next 2 years  that sacred trust will be honored by action .,Republican
we will continue to defend our homeland and prosecute the war on terror without retreat  and without excuses .,Republican
we will provide our military  and their families  with the resources they need to do their heroic work on behalf of the nation they serve .,Republican
we will hold rogue regimes accountable for their mischief  and hold fast to our friends around the world  from defiant democrats in israel and taiwan  to longstanding comrades-in-arms like the british and australians  to our resurgent allies in new europe .,Republican
we will work with our ever-expanding coalition of the willing to secure the fledging democracies in afghanistan and iraq  and with every political  economic  diplomatic and military tool at our disposal  see the war on terror through to victory .,Republican
domestically  our agenda will be no less audacious .,Republican
we will continue the work begun in president bush 's first term to cultivate an opportunity society of economic choice and independence .,Republican
we will continue to break down the walls  erected by 40 years of liberal policies  between the american people and their dreams .,Republican
we will continue to provide seniors with access to affordable  quality health care while empowering them with unprecedented retirement security .,Republican
we will continue to take on the three-headed monster of over-taxation  over-litigation and over-regulation that cuts the legs out from every sector of our economy .,Republican
and while the 109th congress helps increase our national security and prosperity  we will also help american families raise their children in a society defined by the values that made our nation secure and prosperous in the first place .,Republican
we will continue to better protect and educate our children  to protect the institution of marriage  to protect the constitution from judicial activism  and protect the role of family and faith in the public square .,Republican
this rules package before us now will help us do this important work  work the american people have hired us to do .,Republican
and yet  rather than laying out a positive vision for the next 2 years  or for that matter even discussing the substance of the rules package itself  some may choose this debate to launch the first of what i imagine will be countless personal attacks against the integrity of the majority and  ultimately  the integrity of this institution .,Republican
it is a new year  mr.,Republican
speaker  but an old game  and one to which we can not afford to stoop .,Republican
too much is at stake ; too much depends on the success of this historic 109th congress .,Republican
to my friends on the other side of the aisle  i would remind them all that i know what it means to be in the minority  to go into contentious votes certain of defeat  to always react to an agenda set by opponents .,Republican
but i must also remind them that when republicans were in the minority  we engaged in the battle of ideas .,Republican
we developed  and specifically proposed  a substantive vision for the future of our nation .,Republican
in the 10 years since that vision was endorsed by our countrymen  we have been honored to work with all members of the minority on one issue or the other to develop successful legislative coalitions .,Republican
with our close partisan margins and 24-hour media culture  we sometimes forget we are opponents  not enemies .,Republican
we would all do well to remember that  especially given the stakes  the significance and  frankly  the sheer weight of the agenda before us .,Republican
so i urge all members to support the rules package before us so we can immediately get to work on behalf of the men and women who sent us here .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am honored to once again serve as leader ; but even with all of the gratitude i feel toward you  our conference and toward this body  the source of the honor i feel today is not all in this chamber .,Republican
the source of the honor each of us rightfully feels today is our friends and families who have given us their love  the american people who have given us their trust  the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line for us every day  and our heavenly creator who knitted us together in the womb .,Republican
mr. speaker  may god bless the work and workers of the 109th congress  may god bless the cause of justice and freedom around the world  and may god continue to bless the united states of america .,Republican
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent that the balance of the time allocated to me be controlled by the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
dreier ) xz4001150 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would like to inform you that i was absent for rollcall vote no .,Republican
10 and rollcall vote no .,Republican
11 on january 26  2005 .,Republican
these votes were on amendments to h.r.,Republican
54  the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 .,Republican
i respectfully request that it be entered into the congressional record that if present  i would have voted : rollcall vote no .,Republican
10  on the crowley amendment -- '' no '' ; rollcall vote no .,Republican
11  on the crowley amendment -- '' no .,Republican
'',Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  let me close by first indicating to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
crowley ) xz4000870 that the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 as well as myself acknowledge that the folks who received the medal in the past were most deserving .,Republican
i would point out  in fact  that the medal that was awarded  for example  to ronald and nancy reagan  was one medal  and the same thing with dr .,Republican
king and coretta scott king  and betty and gerald ford .,Republican
couples are treated much differently from a group .,Republican
i guess perhaps what i found in studying this  perhaps the most egregious example of going beyond what the initial scope of the medal was was in the 106th congress where we awarded five medal bills  one of them was for the navajo code talkers which did not go in regular order .,Republican
it was attached at the last minute to an appropriations bill .,Republican
it not only covered the 29 original code talkers but also an additional 275 of those who qualified as code talkers .,Republican
i guess  and i do not want to speak for the sponsor of the legislation  but i think it points out the need to tighten these requirements .,Republican
that is what the purpose of this legislation is all about .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
today  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
54  the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005  authored by the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700  and urge its immediate passage .,Republican
the legislation is a commonsense effort to maintain the prestige of this award .,Republican
as the members know  the gold medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by congress .,Republican
it has been awarded to a long and distinguished line of individuals who have made significant contributions to this country  beginning with general george washington even before the declaration of independence .,Republican
recipients have included civil rights leaders  cultural icons and leaders in science .,Republican
but a disturbing trend has emerged since the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 sensibly reformed the commemorative coin program a decade ago .,Republican
until that point  congress approved the awarding of only a few  usually one or two  gold medals each congress  but approved as many as a dozen commemorative coin programs  often at great cost to taxpayers .,Republican
chairman castle 's reforms eliminated the cost to the taxpayers  restoring the dignity to the commemorative coin program .,Republican
he also instituted a requirement that two-thirds of the house should sponsor legislation for either commemorative coins or gold medals before consideration could take place so that support would be broad and bipartisan .,Republican
those reforms have been successful  but denied the opportunity to enact numerous commemorative coin programs  congress increasingly has turned to the gold medal program  and we now find ourselves in a situation of having fewer honorees for commemorative coins than we do from gold medals .,Republican
during the last congress  only three commemorative coins were struck  and we approved five medal programs honoring seven individuals .,Republican
by comparison  in the first 123 years of the gold medal  only 45 people were so honored .,Republican
mr. chairman  all medal honorees to date have been good choices and well deserving of the honor .,Republican
however  we could be faced with a quandary : either approve a medal for an individual who has had some accomplishment  but probably is not at the same level as a general washington or a jonas salk  or else decline to approve the legislation .,Republican
we should not let ourselves get into that situation  mr.,Republican
chairman .,Republican
chairman castle 's common-sense limit of two gold medals a year  and limiting the recipients to individuals rather than groups  maintains the prestige and honor of receiving a congressional gold medal .,Republican
combined with the requirement of a minimum cosponsorship level of two-thirds of the house is the best way to preserve the integrity of the gold medal .,Republican
at the appropriate time  i will offer a manager 's amendment that seeks to change the effective date of this legislation from december 31 of this year to immediately upon enactment so that the rules for awarding medals would remain the same throughout this congress and not change midsession .,Republican
mr. chairman  i urge immediate passage of this legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
if the bill were passed  the answer is no  they would not .,Republican
reclaiming my time  and the gentleman may want to respond .,Republican
let me just comment .,Republican
there is an avenue  i would suggest to my friend from new york  to honor large groups .,Republican
that would be the commemorative coin .,Republican
it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins  and for good reason  that we then had this increase in the gold medal .,Republican
i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionally supports the concept of honoring an individual for service to the country  and that the commemorative coin  which has been essentially put on the back burner  presents a very appropriate avenue for recognizing groups that heretofore have not been honored .,Republican
i think that the reforms in the past and the ones that the gentleman from delaware is now propounding in this bill makes excellent sense .,Republican
i think once the members understand the changes  that they are going to gravitate toward the concept of a commemorative coin as opposed to the gold medal .,Republican
that is precisely what the gentleman from delaware proposes in this legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700  the sponsor of the legislation .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from new york .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from new york .,Republican
let me  in closing  mr.,Republican
chairman  indicate  first of all  my respect for the members who have undertaken the responsibility of going out and getting 290 signatures .,Republican
virtually everyone i have talked to said  never again  because of the difficulty .,Republican
i said  well  think of it this way .,Republican
you get a chance to meet a lot of new friends .,Republican
every time you walk over or ride over for a vote  every time you see a member in the dining room  wherever it may be  you are getting their support .,Republican
but it is a difficult process .,Republican
i think the gentleman from delaware was right in raising that bar to where it is now  because it really does focus one 's attention on how difficult that process is .,Republican
it does make it  by definition  a bipartisan process .,Republican
that is a fact of life that we deal with time and time again .,Republican
the legislation before us  i think  does restore the medal to what it was envisioned to be way back in 1776 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  let me point out in the case of the navajo code talkers  there were other tribes also that had code talkers  not just the navajo .,Republican
again  the issue is where do we start and where do we finish in this area .,Republican
again  going back to the history of the medal  and the first recipient was george washington  it was to an individual and was to an individual for a very  very long period of time .,Republican
the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 pointed out correctly  historically the gold medal was given out quite rarely  45 in 123 years  to individuals .,Republican
the change ironically was brought about with the change in the commemorative coin program that did in fact move the congress to adopting more gold medals .,Republican
this is an effort to try to get back to where history started us  awarding that medal to an individual and awarding it not to a group  no matter how small or how large  and that really was the intent of the legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself as much time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  the amendment changes the effective date of the introduced version of the bill from after december 31  2005 to instead make the new limitation on the number of congressional gold medals effective on enactment of the bill .,Republican
the change will be made so that uniform guidelines governing the medal program will be in effect for the whole 109th congress and beyond and not change in the middle of the congress .,Republican
if we were to pass the bill but leave the effective date until the end of the session there would be a land rush to enact bills on gold medals that would place members in an awkward position .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
in any federal building whatsoever .,Republican
on federal property is what the law says .,Republican
it is a violation of the law .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700  the sponsor of the legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 .,Republican
i yield to my friend from delaware  the sponsor of the legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  to close  and again in opposition  i think it is unfortunate and really not necessary to put republican-democrat in the statute .,Republican
that is really what we are trying to do ; that is what the gentleman from new york is trying to do .,Republican
this is an issue that needs to be worked out at the leadership level  which traditionally has been the case .,Republican
the last example that the gentleman mentioned  i do not know what all that had to do with  but i think it was above our pay grade .,Republican
but at the same time  that is how it works  and to encase republican and democrat in the statute i think at this time would certainly not be in the best interests of the process  and that is why i continue to oppose my friend 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit .,Republican
mr. chairman  on rollcall no .,Republican
10 i was unavoidably detained .,Republican
had i been present  i would have voted `` no .,Republican
'',Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 42 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york is really in many ways contrary to the reforms that are already enacted  led by the gentleman from delaware and the one that is now before us .,Republican
the institution of two-thirds of the members was very important  and the reforms in the commemorative coin reform act  which was adopted almost 10 years ago  instituted a two-coin-per-year maximum .,Republican
the reforms in that program have worked perfectly .,Republican
congress has not passed more than two programs for issue in any year since the law passed in 1996 .,Republican
one year  in 2003  only one coin was issued .,Republican
the reforms have restored the dignity of the commemorative coin program  which had spun out of control ; and similar reforms will do the same for a congressional gold medal .,Republican
so it seems to me a natural progression in the reform process .,Republican
and  indeed  mr.,Republican
chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
first of all  mr.,Republican
speaker  let me point out that this is a motion with instructions  so it does not go back to the committee on financial services  it would automatically come back to the floor .,Republican
secondly  i want to applaud the gentleman from delaware  who sponsored this legislation .,Republican
the concept behind the gold medal  the highest award that the congress can provide  has historically been given  historically  to an individual .,Republican
the first individual was george washington  even before the declaration of independence .,Republican
historically that was the case .,Republican
in the first 123 years of the existence of our country  only 45 medals were given out  all of them to individuals .,Republican
since that time  we have had a tenfold increase in the next subsequent 100 years .,Republican
and the gentleman from delaware is right  we need to reform the system .,Republican
there is bipartisanship in the existing system because it involves 290 cosponsors  so everybody gets an opportunity to weigh in on the importance of the medal .,Republican
there is an opportunity now with commemorative coins to honor groups as opposed to the individual medal .,Republican
so the gentleman from delaware needs to be congratulated on forward-looking reforms  just as he did in the commemorative coin program .,Republican
this is an effort  really  to gut these reforms  this so-called motion to recommit  and that is why i oppose it .,Republican
we had extensive debate during general debate  as well as the two amendments offered by my friend from new york  and so i would ask that the motion to recommit be defeated ; that we pass this legislation ; and then get on to the work of defining two medals each year  a maximum of two medals each year  four for the congress  to honor individuals who have had extraordinary contributions to our country .,Republican
let us go back to what the original intent of the founding fathers was in this gold medal .,Republican
i think it is important to do so .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
hastings ) xz4001701  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only .,Republican
mr. speaker  this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on financial services .,Republican
it provides that the bill shall be considered as read for the purpose of amendment and makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying this resolution .,Republican
it provides that the amendments made in order may be offered only in the order printed in the report  may be offered only by a member designated in the report  shall be considered as read  shall be debatable for the time specified in the report  equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent .,Republican
these amendments shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject mr.,Republican
speaker  i rise today to introduce this fair  structured rule for h.r.,Republican
54  the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 .,Republican
this legislation builds on important reforms that my good friend  the former governor and now member of congress  the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 has made to the commemorative gold coin program almost a decade ago .,Republican
today  we have the opportunity to bring these same improvements to the congressional gold medal program and ensure that the original intent and prestige of the congressional gold medal program as the nation 's highest civilian award and the most distinguished award given by congress is preserved .,Republican
mr. speaker  h.r.,Republican
54 will improve the congressional gold medal program by limiting the number of medals awarded by congress to no more than two in any calendar year .,Republican
it would also ensure that the tradition of only awarding these medals to living or recently deceased individuals for their meritorious service continues  as was originally intended by the program .,Republican
the proud tradition of this unique honor began when the first congressional gold medal was authorized in 1776 and presented to george washington in 1790 .,Republican
the tradition of only awarding these medals for military service continued until 1858 when congress awarded dr .,Republican
frederick rose  an assistant surgeon in the british navy  with a medal for the kindness that he showed to sick american naval personnel .,Republican
with dr .,Republican
rose 's receipt of the gold medal  congress also created the medal of honor as the first permanent military decoration .,Republican
the creation of the esteemed medal of honor allowed congress to begin using the gold medal exclusively to recognize individuals that have performed an achievement that has an impact on american history and culture that will be recognized for generations to come .,Republican
over the years since its inception  without strict rules governing how it was awarded  this venerable program has acquired a small problem .,Republican
by a slow process  as currently administered  it has grown much larger than it was originally intended .,Republican
from 1776  when congress established the award  to 1904  congress approved only 47 medals .,Republican
in the last 100 years  congress has awarded almost twice as many  86 medals  including 20 in the past decade alone .,Republican
in the 1990s  congress faced this same problem of proliferation within the commemorative coins program  which has grown out of control and was costing taxpayers far more than ever envisioned when that program began .,Republican
in order to maintain sound fiscal discipline and the prestige of the congressional gold medal program  we are here today to approve the commonsense reforms by the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700  our chairman  and supported by the committee on financial services chairman  the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
oxley ) xz4003070 .,Republican
many of these reforms simply codify what is already an existing practice in the house committee on financial services and the senate banking committee .,Republican
by adopting this legislation  congress will be able to move more effectively and efficiently to manage the congressional gold medal program while maintaining the prestige and the purpose for which it was originally created .,Republican
i support this rule and urge my colleagues to do the same .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i ask unanimous consent that section 2 of the resolution be stricken .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  today we have a bill which the gentleman from delaware ( mr.,Republican
castle ) xz4000700 has brought to the floor  which we believe is a good bill  supported by the gentleman from ohio ( chairman oxley ) .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this rule  as well as the oxley manager 's amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time  and i move the previous question on the resolution .,Republican
the previous question was ordered .,Republican
the resolution was agreed to .,Republican
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of h. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
36 .,Republican
once again  activist judges threaten our authority  first of all  to direct federal fund spending ; and  second of all  they attempt to create law .,Republican
we have required here in congress at universities that receive federal dollars to extend access to military recruiters equal to other outside groups .,Republican
but in the name of free speech and association  some schools seek to deny their students access to recruiters and rotc  obviously afraid that their students would maybe even make a wrong choice .,Republican
it is ironic that an institution whose sole function  whole reason for being  is based on the free exchange of ideas  would then boycott the armed forces  the very people who actively protect their academic freedom .,Republican
it is further ironic that those who are often noted for concern that low-income americans are serving in disproportionate numbers in the armed forces would block many of their students born with a silver spoon access to rotc .,Republican
my own son currently serves in iraq .,Republican
he graduated near the top of his class from the u.s. naval academy ; and  last sunday  he had the satisfaction of witnessing the birth of freedom in a land where for 50 years freedom has been an exotic concept .,Republican
by passing h. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
36  we reassert our support for freedom and our disdain for those liberal  elite institutions that seek to sensor choices for their wealthy clientele .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i appreciate the comments from the gentleman from florida  my good friend from the committee on rules  and would like to ask him at this time if he would like to consume the time .,Republican
at this time  i may have one additional speaker  but do not at this time and would wish that the gentleman would consume his time .,Republican
then i would expect to close .,Republican
i would like to ask the gentleman if he would like to do that .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in full support of this resolution and urge my colleagues to support its passage .,Republican
asking the administration to appeal the third circuit is the right thing to do .,Republican
what is happening on some college campuses is deja vu for those of us who attended colleges in the 1960s and the 1970s .,Republican
back then too many college administrators lacked the courage to resist pressure from then what were called left-wing student groups and other professors to ban military recruiters from their campuses .,Republican
as a result  students who sought military careers were denied equal access to careers of their choice and our schools became the centers for a wide range of nonsense courses .,Republican
the student protestors of the 1960s and 1970s and those of like mind are now the administrators and professors of colleges and universities all over the country .,Republican
clearly  they have neither changed their politics nor loathing for the american military .,Republican
even at a time when our servicemen and -women are encouraged to defeat the forces of tyranny and terror  they remain the same .,Republican
in denying military recruiters equal access to campuses such as harvard law school  college administrators violate the most basic principles of the right to associate and free speech they so profess is precious .,Republican
despite large numbers of conservative students attending their institutions  these liberals preach tolerance ; however  these liberal administrators and professors have now become the most intolerant people i know .,Republican
the following quote is from a student typical of the attitude of many of these ivory bastions : `` the day my political science department hires a republican and i am allowed to sit in a class without a number of snickers  jeers  and/or dirty looks when president bush 's name is even mentioned is the day i will admit there is progress on today 's campus.,Republican
'' mr.,Republican
speaker  congress did not ask for special access for military recruiters .,Republican
we are asking for just equal access to groups such as those seeking support for such liberal causes as abortion rights  frivolous lawsuits  same-sex marriage  elimination of the right to private property  gun control  orwellian big government .,Republican
mr. speaker  once again activist judges have clearly overstepped their authority  and it is time for the administration to stand and say that the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit was wrong in their ruling and please seek an appeal .,Republican
mr. speaker  let me thank my colleague for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  today i rise in strong support of this resolution  which shows our nation 's unwavering commitment to both higher education and providing a strong national defense .,Republican
at no time in recent memory has our country placed more responsibility on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform .,Republican
we are fighting a war on terrorism on multiple fronts  in afghanistan and iraq .,Republican
and it is essential that if we are to be victorious in defending our freedom and protecting our homeland that we promote military service as an option to college students across the united states .,Republican
when this congress passed and president bush signed into law the no child left behind act  the bill made it easier for military recruiters to inform america 's high school students about their options to serve their country  while also giving parents a choice about whether or not they want their sons and daughters to be contacted individually by military recruiters .,Republican
now in this resolution we are reiterating the choices given to institutions of higher education .,Republican
the solomon act  originally passed in 1995  grants the secretary of defense power to deny federal funding to institutions of higher learning if they prohibit military recruitment on campus .,Republican
this law recognizes the importance of having a capable  educated and well-prepared military  one that is ready to defend american liberties such as freedom of speech and higher education .,Republican
if we deny armed forces recruiters the opportunity to actively recruit in schools  we not only disrespect the sacrifices of military men and women who have made our freedom possible ; we also rob our students of the valuable opportunities that military service can be to our nation and what they can help provide .,Republican
there is no reason not to allow the nation 's armed services to make their best case to college students and to do so in the same manner as private sector employers that colleges and universities seem to relish having on campus .,Republican
denial of access and equality to military recruiters by colleges that receive federal funds is an insult to the taxpayers who help subsidize higher education in this country .,Republican
many nations have mandatory military service for their citizens .,Republican
we do not .,Republican
the very core of our system of homeland security and national defense depends on young men and women deciding that they wish to serve our country .,Republican
successful recruitment of the best officers in our military relies heavily on our military recruiters ' access to the best and the brightest .,Republican
and it seems a bit disingenuous for the elite institutions of higher education  such as harvard  yale  stanford  georgetown  and new york university  to condemn the lack of the wealthy and privileged in the ranks of our military while these schools deny their students the option of even hearing about a career in our united states military .,Republican
this resolution should not be politicized .,Republican
it is a straightforward reaffirmation of our armed forces and our students .,Republican
congress does not force colleges and universities to accept federal funding .,Republican
if an institution of higher learning wishes to bar military recruiters from recruiting  it is free to do so .,Republican
but federal funding is not an entitlement and such institutions should not expect that decision to be endorsed and subsidized by the taxpayers of the united states .,Republican
the resolution reaffirms our commitment to that principle .,Republican
and i want to commend the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) and i also want to thank the gentleman from minnesota ( mr.,Republican
kline ) for bringing this resolution to the floor and urge my colleagues to support it .,Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 59 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
mcgovern ) xz4002630  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only .,Republican
mr. speaker  on tuesday the committee on rules met and granted a rule for house concurrent resolution 36  expressing congressional support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education .,Republican
the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on armed services .,Republican
the rule also provides for one motion to recommit .,Republican
mr. speaker  this concurrent resolution is an important first step in addressing a misguided ruling by the third circuit court of appeals regarding access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education .,Republican
during this time of conflict and the global war on terror  it is more important than ever to maintain the ability to recruit quality men and women for service in our military .,Republican
the primary way that recruiters are able to do this is to work through those institutions which work closely with our young men and women  schools and universities .,Republican
military recruiters need the same access to college campuses provided to other potential employers  and students deserve the right to discuss the option of a career in the united states military with the representatives of the armed forces .,Republican
mr. speaker  some ask  why the need for this concurrent resolution ?,Republican
well  the answer is succinct .,Republican
this concurrent resolution grows out of an egregious decision by the third circuit court of appeals overturning the power of congress to control the purse .,Republican
this decision simply states that congress and the government may not as a matter of law deny funds to universities on the basis of their denial of access to recruiters and rotc units .,Republican
this decision  couched in the language of civil rights  fails to recognize the underlying inequity behind these university policies .,Republican
this decision asserts the congress has compelled speech by these universities to the effect that they `` agree '' with the military 's `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy with respect to homosexuals in the service .,Republican
mr. speaker  nothing could be further than the truth .,Republican
the solomon amendment compelled no such thing .,Republican
it simply proposed standards for the receipt of federal funds .,Republican
setting such standards is a normal and legitimate function of the legislative branch .,Republican
it is what defines the power of the purse .,Republican
this is an issue that the house and senate have revisited and affirmed in bipartisan votes in 1995  1996  1999  and 2002 after the enactment of the original solomon amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  it is disappointing to note that the reserve officers training corps  or popularly known as the rotc  has been embattled on some university and college campuses since the 1960s .,Republican
this stems from what only can be described as a consistently anti-military philosophy advocated by some  and i want to say only some  college and university professors and administrators .,Republican
the new purported reasons for not allowing rotc on campus often serves the convenient cover for these anti-military sentiments .,Republican
some educators now believe that they should be allowed to discriminate against students who wish to enter the military in order to please another group of students who object to the policies and procedures of the armed services  all the while soliciting and accepting federal funds for their institutions .,Republican
this is rank hypocrisy .,Republican
why would an institution seek and use federal funds  often from the department of defense  while denying representatives of the u.s. armed forces access to their campuses ?,Republican
mr. speaker  the decision by the third circuit court of appeals is a classic case of judicial overreach and one that must be addressed .,Republican
as a former university educator and the son of a career air force noncommissioned officer  i find this decision disturbing and insulting to those men and women who defend our freedom and to those who wish to join their ranks .,Republican
the very least we can do is put the courts on notice as to exactly where the congress stands on this issue .,Republican
for that reason  this concurrent resolution is necessary and timely .,Republican
hopefully  it will underscore the importance that the congress places on military recruiters having access to the educational institutions that receive federal funds .,Republican
during this time of war  we should insist that institutions who pride themselves on freedom of expression allow the defenders of that freedom  the united states military  to freely recruit the soldiers who protect our democracy .,Republican
to that end  i urge support for the rule and the underlying bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield to myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i would like to quickly address a couple of the concerns that my colleague raised .,Republican
while i certainly respect his concerns  i would like to point out that the measure in question had been on our web site for 4 days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday .,Republican
it had easy access .,Republican
frankly  on the nature of the rule itself  it is the opinion of the majority of the committee this is simply an up or down matter .,Republican
it is not something we need to amend or deal with .,Republican
let me make one other point  if i may  mr.,Republican
speaker  in reference to the access of the military to college campuses .,Republican
the military is a rather unique institution  but nothing prohibits college campuses from denying them access .,Republican
all the solomon amendment does is says  if they do  they lose some federal funds as a consequence .,Republican
i would think that if they felt strongly  that this was a position of conviction  they would not want funds from the department of defense and other institutions .,Republican
they would simply have nothing to do with them .,Republican
further  i would simply like to make one additional point .,Republican
the appropriate place to protest the policy  frankly  is in the political arena .,Republican
this is not a policy in the department of defense per se .,Republican
this is a policy devised by president clinton  has been ratified repeatedly by congress as a political avenue to address it .,Republican
we should not put that burden on recruiters in the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
akin ) xz4000050 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
gingrey ) xz4001510 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and in closing  i would like to say i think we have had a good and substantive debate today  but let us be clear : the concurrent resolution is really about ensuring those who defend our freedom and liberty the ability to have the same access to colleges and universities that is available for everyone else .,Republican
mr. speaker  often today others have placed this debate in the context of the `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' policy .,Republican
i suggest that those who would like to change that policy  that they look inward  at the political process itself .,Republican
this was president clinton 's policy  and one enshrined in law that can only be changed by congress .,Republican
if the other side of the aisle would like to make this change  they should propose it and debate it at this level .,Republican
to put it in the context of the solomon amendment  i believe  is disingenuous and dangerous to our recruiting efforts .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying concurrent resolution .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time  and i move the previous question on the resolution .,Republican
the previous question was ordered .,Republican
the resolution was agreed to .,Republican
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  and today i rise in strong support of the solomon amendment and as a proud cosponsor of the resolution that is before us .,Republican
for the last several years  a growing number of law schools have subjected military recruiters to various degrees of harassment designed to make military recruiting difficult and to frustrate their objectives .,Republican
military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces retains highly qualified new military personnel ; and it is an integral  effective  and necessary part of overall military recruiting .,Republican
the constitution gives congress the power to attach reasonable stipulations to those who accept federal dollars .,Republican
the solomon law simply ensures that the military has fair access to recruited institutions of higher learning that willingly accept this federal funding .,Republican
mr. speaker  every year  without fail  the military comes under a great deal of criticism for hiring too many low-income  disadvantaged young adults .,Republican
however  i find it remarkably ironic that these institutions are obstructing a more balanced recruiting effort that includes a patriotic commitment from all sectors of society .,Republican
furthermore  the point has to be made that the soldiers  sailors  airmen  and marines that are being treated like second-class citizens at these universities are also the same brave men and women that are providing the freedom these schools enjoy .,Republican
mr. speaker  efforts by these universities to restrict military recruiter access can only have the harmful effect of increasing federal spending to achieve mandated end-strength goals and ultimately compromising the readiness and performance of our military .,Republican
in conclusion  mr.,Republican
speaker  i strongly support this resolution .,Republican
i sincerely hope there will be a strong bipartisan effort of support  and i commend my good friends from minnesota and alabama for their leadership on this issue .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
i want to speak certainly in favor of the solomon amendment and remind my colleagues that it does not apply to institutions of higher education that have had a longstanding practice of pacificism based on historic religious grounds  and it exempts federal student financial assistance from termination .,Republican
but what it does do is allow students to look at career opportunities in the army .,Republican
and as the chairman of the committee on armed services said  there are so many legal issues involved in the military today and to go beyond that  to let people look at careers in  i would say  intelligence as much as anything  homeland security  there is a great opportunity for students to go into .,Republican
but we are also seeing so much push-back really from a crowd that is basically anti-american and anti-conservative .,Republican
indeed  there are so many prejudices against everyday middle-class values on college campuses  and serving in the military and being pro-american just seems to be one of them .,Republican
students at wells college  for example  were ridiculed by their professors if they supported the war in iraq .,Republican
at the university of missouri  a professor  a science professor  offered extra credit for students to protest a speech given by conservative activist david horowitz .,Republican
at the university of richmond  a professor called president bush a moron in his class .,Republican
and at the university of oregon  students were labeled `` neo-nazi '' for expressing their opinion that trent lott was the victim of a double standard .,Republican
and examples go on and on .,Republican
another statistic  the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of well-known college campuses have speech codes intended to ban or punish politically incorrect  almost always conservative speech  and that campus funds are unequally distributed to left-wing groups as opposed to conservative groups by a ratio of 50 to one .,Republican
i think the judicial attack on the solomon amendment is just one of a series of a trend that is against  again  anything that is pro-american  pro-conservative  pro-traditional values .,Republican
and so i would submit for the record an article that was an opinion in the wall street journal recently and then something on the academic bill of rights that i think also touches into this same subject .,Republican
the bill would express the continued support of congress for the so-called `` solomon law '' in title 10  u.s. code  which improves dod 's ability to establish and maintain rotc detachments and to ensure military recruiters have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope to that provided to other employers .,Republican
the bill would : state congress 's resolve to achieve military personnel readiness through vigorous application of the `` solomon law '' relating to equal access for military recruits to institutions of higher education  and express congress 's commitment to explore all options  including the use of its constitutional power to appropriate funds  to achieve that equal access .,Republican
express the sense of congress that the executive branch should aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the `` solomon law.,Republican
'' encourage the executive branch to follow a doctrine of non-acquiescene by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on other jurisdictions .,Republican
the so-called `` solomon law  '' section 983  title 10  u.s. code  named for its original proponent representative gerald solomon ( r-ny )  is based on the principle that if a college or university accepts federal funding it must permit military recruiters and/or rotc access to campus and to students .,Republican
enacted first in 1994  and added to by congress in 1996  1999 and 2002  and 2004  the `` solomon law '' prohibits some defense-related and other federal funding from going to colleges and universities that prevent rotc access or military recruiting on campus .,Republican
the solomon law : ( 1 ) does not apply to institutions of higher education that have a long-standing policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds ; and  ( 2 ) exempts federal student financial assistance from termination .,Republican
the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit  on 29 november 2004  reversed a district court decision  which had upheld the constitutionality of the `` solomon law  '' by ruling that the `` solomon law '' violated the 1st amendment rights of free speech and association held by institutions of higher education .,Republican
the third circuit remanded the case to the district court to enter a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the `` solomon law.,Republican
'' the acting solicitor general has announced his intention to petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the third circuit court .,Republican
the government also filed a motion on 14 january 2005 with the third circuit court seeking to stay the court 's mandate for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the `` solomon law '' until the supreme court decides the government 's petition .,Republican
the third circuit granted the stay on 19 january .,Republican
h. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
36  in expressing continued support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education  makes the following points regarding the `` solomon law '' : under article i  section 8  of the constitution  congress exclusively has the power to raise and support armies  provide and maintain a navy  and make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces .,Republican
military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces obtain highly qualified new military personnel and is an integral  effective and necessary part of overall military recruiting .,Republican
efforts by colleges and universities to restrict or prohibit military recruiter access will have the harmful effects of increasing federal spending to achieve desired recruiting outcomes and of compromising military readiness and performance .,Republican
such harm conflicts with federal responsibilities to provide for the nation 's defense .,Republican
any reduction in the performance by the armed forces amidst the present national emergency declared by the president on september 14  2001  operates against the national interest .,Republican
the constitution gives congress the power to regulate spending and in that role congress has chosen over time to appropriate funds for a variety of government programs to be provided to institutions of higher learning .,Republican
however  these funds are not an entitlement to any college or university and can be provided subject to criteria and conditions set by congress .,Republican
the `` solomon law '' is a legislative safeguard that links federal funding of educational institutions to the willingness of those institutions to abide by a rule of access by military recruiters to campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope that is provided to any other employer .,Republican
for the last several years  a growing number of university law schools and colleges of law have treated military recruiters in ways significantly different from the recruiters of other employers .,Republican
as a result  military recruiters and the persons they seek to interview have been subjected to various degrees of official and unofficial harassment or ill treatment that is designed to make military recruiting difficult  or to frustrate its objectives .,Republican
the underlying reason for this differing treatment is opposition to federal law that prohibits military service by openly gay people -- the so-called `` do n't ask  do n't tell '' law .,Republican
given that opposition  it is imperative that the safeguards that the `` solomon law '' provides not only for military recruiters  but also for rotc  be maintained .,Republican
without such safeguards  grave harm to military recruiting will result as colleges and universities move to limit or deny access to campuses and students by representatives of the armed forces .,Republican
academic bill of rights hiring practices for professors faculty hiring is controlled by more senior members of the faculty itself : as conservative faculty forced to keep political views quiet until they achieve tenure .,Republican
usually hire those who agree with them  creates a perpetual cycle .,Republican
creates an environment where marxists  post-modernists  etc .,Republican
can still dominate in academic fields even while their views have been discredited : numbers of liberal professors vs .,Republican
conservative professors the overall ratio of democrats to republicans at the 32 schools studied was more than 10 to 1 ( 1397 democrats  134 republicans ) .,Republican
not a single department at a single one of the 32 schools managed to achieve a reasonable parity between the two main political parties : in the nation at large  registered democrats and republicans are roughly equal in number .,Republican
the closest any school came to parity was northwestern university -- democrats outnumbered registered republicans by a ratio of 4-1 .,Republican
other schools : other schools had zero registered republicans : most students probably graduate without ever having a class taught by a professor with a conservative viewpoint .,Republican
not just a faculty problem but a campus-wide bias for example  the university of pennsylvania  carnegie melon  and cornell could not identify a single republican administrator .,Republican
in the entire ivy league  there were only 3 republican administrators identified .,Republican
impact on students remarks belittling conservative ideas convey that these views are not accepted on campus -- grading based on these ideas reinforce this perception .,Republican
one student called a `` fascist '' for inviting oliver north to campus .,Republican
university of oregon -- student labeled `` neo-nazi '' for expressing his opinion that trent lott was the victim of a double standard .,Republican
university of richmond -- professor called president bush a `` moron '' in the classroom .,Republican
university of missouri in columbia -- professor offered extra credit to protest a speech by david horowitz .,Republican
students at wells college were ridiculed by professors for their support on iraq war and their views on feminism .,Republican
`` it did n't take long to see how liberal it was after i came here .,Republican
the professors and the education i receive is excellent  but the professors seem to use class as a political soapbox  '' -- kristy l. hochenberger  a student at wells college .,Republican
slogan circulated by biology professor at wells college -- '' lobotomies for republicans : it 's not just a good idea ; it 's the law !,Republican
`` .,Republican
many students conceal what they actually think in order to protect their academic standing -- a reality clearly at odds with the educational mission of the university .,Republican
nearly all distinguished doctoral programs rely on matching students with professors who have compatible interests .,Republican
preferential treatment shown to those with similar liberal ideals .,Republican
campus guests  speech police and commencement speakers campus funds are unequally distributed to leftwing student groups as opposed to groups with conservative agendas by a ratio close to 50 : 1 : these student groups are many times in charge of hiring campus speakers .,Republican
the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of well-known college campuses have speech codes intended to ban and punish politically incorrect  almost always conservative  speech .,Republican
the ratio of commencement speakers on the left and right was 226-15  a ratio of over 15 : 1 : commencement speakers are selected through committees composed of administrative staff  faculty  and students .,Republican
twenty-two of the thirty-two schools surveyed did not have a single republican or conservative commencement speaker in the entire ten years surveyed : six of the remaining schools invited only one republican or conservative each  as compared to 38 liberals or democrats .,Republican
haverford  swarthmore and ucla  which host multiple speakers every year  did not feature a single republican or conservative speaker as balanced against 54 liberals and democrats .,Republican
academic bill of rights recognizes that political partisanship by professors is an abuse of students ' academic freedom .,Republican
designed to take politics out of the university curriculum : does not call for more classics in curriculum  reading lists should provide students with dissenting viewpoints so they may form their own opinions .,Republican
designed to protect the right of students to `` get an education rather than an indoctrination '' : should not make professors afraid of what they say  we defend professors ' right to say anything and forbids administration from punishing them for their political opinions  professors should always be open to dissenting opinions .,Republican
unequal funding of student organizations which host guest speakers is unacceptable : calls for pluralism in selection of guest speakers .,Republican
learning environment hostile to conservatives is wrong .,Republican
there is a lack of `` intellectual diversity '' within faculties on college campuses : university should be `` inclusive '' to all viewpoints  without it  free exchange of ideas are impaired .,Republican
it is not our intention to suggest that there should be quotas based on party affiliation in the hiring process at universities : we support removing all politics and political affiliation from the hiring process  it is our purpose to point out the gross imbalance of liberal vs .,Republican
conservative professors .,Republican
while nearly all university administrations devote extraordinary resources to defend the principle of diversity in regard to race and gender  none can be said to have shown interest in the diversity of ideas .,Republican
universities have the privilege of being separate from the society they inhabit : society grants faculty protection from the influence of outside politics  with that privilege comes a responsibility by the faculty to also safeguard the free exchange of ideas .,Republican
correcting this should be the goal and an integral part of educational policy under the academic bill of rights .,Republican
wisdom of solomon -- the disgrace of blocking military recruiters from campus do n't ask .,Republican
do n't tell .,Republican
having no desire to crash our e-mail server  we 'll save discussion of gays in the military for another day .,Republican
rather  today 's subject is lawyers in the military .,Republican
surely americans of all points of view can agree that in an age of guantanamo and abu ghraib  the military can use the best attorneys it can get .,Republican
so it 's a disgrace that some of the nation 's law schools  objecting to the pentagon 's `` discrimination policies  '' refuse to permit military recruiters to make their pitch on campus  relegating them instead to unofficial off-campus venues .,Republican
law students pondering their first career move can be wined and dined by fancy firms that set up recruitment tables at campus job fairs  but they have to stroll over to the local day 's inn to seek out the lonely military recruiter .,Republican
to put it another way  the same liberals who object that the military includes too many lower-class kids wo n't let military recruiters near the schools that contain students who will soon join the upper-class elite .,Republican
it 's almost enough to make us contemplate restoring the draft  starting with law school students .,Republican
needless to say  such scholastic shenanigans do n't go down well with congress  which in 1994 passed the solomon amendment  named for the late new york republican  gerald solomon .,Republican
the law requires schools that receive federal funds to provide equal access to military recruiters .,Republican
today  the house is scheduled to vote on a resolution brought by alabama republican mike rogers that would restate the house 's support for the solomon amendment .,Republican
something similar passed the house and senate by overwhelming margins last year and was incorporated into the defense authorization bill .,Republican
the impetus for mr.,Republican
rogers 's move is a november ruling by the federal appeals court in philadelphia in favor of a group of law schools and legal scholars that had contested the solomon law .,Republican
the 2-1 opinion found that the solomon amendment violates the schools ' first amendment rights to free speech and association .,Republican
next stop is the supreme court  which is expected to take the appeal that the justice department plans to bring .,Republican
there are many peculiarities to this lawsuit  starting with the fact that the group that brought it -- the forum for academic and institutional rights -- declines to release the names of the 26 law schools and faculties that belong to its coalition .,Republican
some of the participants ( new york university and georgetown  for example ) have outed themselves since the suit was brought in 2003  but others steadfastly maintain their own don't-ask-don't-tell policy .,Republican
in any event  there should be no legal question about congress 's right to put conditions on grants of federal funds to universities .,Republican
it does this all the time -- including requirements that colleges adhere to certain civil rights and gender standards .,Republican
with a few exceptions  universities have no trouble going along and courts have no problem letting them .,Republican
if  as is likely  the supreme court overturns the appeals court decision  that will be the end of it .,Republican
almost all universities  public and private  take millions of dollars in federal money that would be next to impossible to give up .,Republican
that 's especially true of the elite schools  both public and private .,Republican
still  it would be nice to think that the nation 's universities would welcome the military for reasons other than the mercenary .,Republican
patriotism  perhaps ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for the distinguished way in which he has conducted the debate and also the gentleman from alabama ( mr.,Republican
rogers ) for sponsoring this resolution .,Republican
mr. speaker  let us make this clear .,Republican
this is not about some social issue .,Republican
the real impetus for this barring of the american military from our college campuses is because of the left-wing core of administrators and professors who do not like this country .,Republican
and we could substitute another protest issue for them in this thing and it would not make a bit of difference .,Republican
these are the same people who in many cases had protests in favor of the viet cong during the vietnam war .,Republican
many of them protested our involvement in el salvador  protested our bringing democracy to nicaragua  protested our participation in the first desert storm in the early 1990s  and in this recent bringing of freedom to iraq .,Republican
they protested all those things .,Republican
they hate all things military .,Republican
and the interesting aspect of this debate is that these same left-wing professors and administrators profess to let young people make up their own minds .,Republican
free thinking is theoretically their trademark .,Republican
let us have some free thinking .,Republican
let us allow the military to be on the campuses .,Republican
let us allow the students to have access to their information  and let us let them make up their own minds .,Republican
there is no draft here .,Republican
this is a volunteer military .,Republican
they do not have to join the military .,Republican
but the idea that the left-wing professors and administrators have to protect the students from that very military that the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
miller ) so eloquently described as the protectors of all of our freedoms including their freedoms to have academic freedoms  to protest and to speak freely  the idea that these students have to be shielded from the guarantors of our freedoms is nonsense .,Republican
i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Republican
mr. chairman  not to prolong the discussion  because i think the gentleman from new york is making some very valid points that should be debated  one of them which is an amendment which is not included here today  and that is the issue of the groups .,Republican
we have checked the history of this .,Republican
to the best of my knowledge  and the gentleman may have some different evidence  i do not think it is different because it is fairly clear who has received these medals  it has always been individuals historically .,Republican
it was never couples .,Republican
that is only something that has happened in the more recent couple of decades  perhaps a couple of times .,Republican
as far as the groups are concerned  there have only been three altogether .,Republican
certainly i am not suggesting any of them are not deserving  for goodness sake .,Republican
they all are .,Republican
the navajo code talkers clearly are deserving .,Republican
that obviously created some problems because of the volume of the medals  and it was done in sort of an unusual procedure .,Republican
the red cross is another very deserving  and so are the veterans of the civil war  which is the other group we found  although that was done much after the civil war .,Republican
there are all kinds of groups out there .,Republican
the congressional gold medal of honor has always been bestowed upon an individual in a very special ceremony to honor that individual .,Republican
it is not easy to get done .,Republican
i do not know if the gentleman has done it .,Republican
as i said before  i did it .,Republican
it is difficult to get 290 signatures on anything around here .,Republican
so it is difficult to get done .,Republican
so obviously it is going to be somebody who is deserving .,Republican
it is going to be as bipartisan as could be .,Republican
you can not do it with one party or the other .,Republican
you have got to get everybody .,Republican
that is what the history of it is .,Republican
we tried to develop this legislation to have a great recognition of what we consider to be the greatest honor this congress can give to a limited number of individuals  which was always what the intent of it was .,Republican
there are a whole lot of ways of recognizing groups .,Republican
you and i could sit here and name groups for hours at a time that could be honored .,Republican
but the congressional gold medal was never really created for that purpose .,Republican
that is the intent of what we are trying to do in the legislation .,Republican
i just wanted to make that point in the history of it .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
conaway ) xz4006550  a member of the committee on armed services .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from alabama ( mr.,Republican
rogers ) xz4003411  the sponsor of this concurrent resolution and a member of the committee on armed services .,Republican
mr. speaker  it gives me great pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
miller ) xz4002791  my colleague on the committee on armed services .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
sweeney ) xz4003930 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
boehner ) xz4000360  the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910  the distinguished chairman of the house committee on armed services .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
kingston ) xz4002210 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
in closing  i would just say that we have heard some discussion today about policies of the united states armed forces for a long time .,Republican
since its inception  there have been special policies applied to our military  the ability to impose nonjudicial punishment  the ability to restrict entry by those who are too tall or too short  the ability to order its members away from home and into combat and into harm 's way .,Republican
but the discussion today is not about those policies and should not be about those policies .,Republican
the discussion today is about keeping our military  keeping our armed forces  the best trained  the best led  the best equipped in the world ; and that means we need the ability to recruit the best and the brightest .,Republican
this is about insisting that our military recruiters have equal access to america 's universities and colleges .,Republican
i urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Republican
i thank my good friend for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in support of equal campus access for our military recruiters .,Republican
recently  a group calling itself freedom for academic and institutional rights  fair  has decided that they disagree with what our military stands for ; and  because of this  they have decided that the military no longer deserves access to our nation 's institutions of higher learning .,Republican
they claim that granting military recruiters equal access to campuses would promote only a pro-military viewpoint and a pro-military recruiting message .,Republican
this is simply not true .,Republican
the government is not asking campuses across america to endorse the war on terror  the president 's policy or anything to do with the military .,Republican
all we are asking for is that the military be afforded the exact same access as other organizations to the student body .,Republican
that is it .,Republican
that is all .,Republican
those who argue that giving equal access somehow constitutes an endorsement of the military are just plain wrong .,Republican
does giving equal access to other groups mean that each institution agrees with every idea that that organization may have ?,Republican
of course not .,Republican
i really think it is ridiculous to argue that point  but fair is arguing just that .,Republican
it is in everyone 's interest to ensure that young people receive information  including military options  so they can make informed choices about their future after they finish their education .,Republican
just because a school disagrees with a career in the military  does that give them the right to deny information about that particular career to someone who might want to sign up ?,Republican
is it right to deny access because you disagree with what someone says ?,Republican
how is that in keeping with the first amendment to the constitution ?,Republican
the position that fair and others have taken is nothing more than thinly veiled hypocrisy .,Republican
they are masking their obvious hatred of our nation 's military by hiding behind the first amendment .,Republican
i think it is wrong .,Republican
i am not going to sit idly by while this so-called fair group trashes our military .,Republican
the constitution in article 1  section 8  states that congress shall have the power to raise and support armies  provide and maintain a navy and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces .,Republican
it does not say that activist judges and institutions of higher education have the right to prevent congress from going about its duty to raise and support the armed forces of these united states .,Republican
were the members of the fair not aware that we were at war and that a state of national emergency has existed in this country since september 11 of 2001 ?,Republican
i am sure they are happy to enjoy the rights afforded to them by the first amendment  but who allows them those rights ?,Republican
perhaps they should reread the old poem to a soldier : `` it is the soldier  not the reporter  who has given us freedom of the press .,Republican
`` it is the soldier  not the poet  who has given us freedom of speech .,Republican
`` it is the soldier  not the campus organizer  who gives us freedom to demonstrate .,Republican
`` it is the soldier who salutes the flag  who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag.,Republican
'' i urge all my colleagues to support this resolution to ensure that the military of these united states continues to have equal access to our nation 's finest young men and women .,Republican
mr. chairman  on rollcall no .,Republican
28 i was unavoidably detained .,Republican
had i been present  i would have voted `` no .,Republican
'',Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i do oppose the amendment .,Republican
i have some empathy for the first amendment offered by the gentleman from new york  but certainly not this one .,Republican
clearly  if there is a bipartisan element to this whole idea of getting two-thirds of the people supporting it  it is the congressional gold medal  and i think the gentleman somewhat undercuts his own argument by giving us the figures that he did because  in fact  i do not think most members  when they are approached by a member carrying that bill  really are concerned about whether it is a republican sponsor or a democrat sponsor .,Republican
they are concerned about who that individual being honored is .,Republican
and just by the definition of having two-thirds sponsor would indicate a strong bipartisan support and historically that has always been the case .,Republican
and i think that the amendment would tend to compartmentalize the authors of these gold medal resolutions that would be difficult to enforce and perhaps would cause some kind of a rush to try to get the necessary signatures prematurely .,Republican
so i think it is really difficult for the committee  for example .,Republican
as the gentleman knows  who has served on my committee with great distinction  we pride ourselves on the bipartisanship of the committee and the leadership of the committee  and we have continued to do so .,Republican
so i think this is superfluous at best and  as a result  would oppose the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong support of h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
as a member of the congressional immigration reform caucus  i join with my colleagues to raise attention to the serious flaws in our immigration system which leave our nation exposed to potential threats .,Republican
the 9/11 commission made several recommendations which were not enacted as part of the national intelligence reform act of 2004 ( public law 108-458 )  including provisions to strengthen identification document standards and to secure our borders .,Republican
the commission specifically recommended that the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses .,Republican
in addition  the commission recommended the department of homeland security 's  dhs  completion of a biometric entry-exit screening system and the improvement of u.s. border security standards for travel and border crossing .,Republican
i was disappointed that the conference committee on the intelligence reform bill opted to remove the immigration-related provisions approved by the house during its consideration of h.r.,Republican
10 last fall .,Republican
i commend house leadership for honoring the commitment made to chairman sensenbrenner to allow the consideration of the bill we have before us today .,Republican
we have a real opportunity to adopt meaningful reforms to improve our immigration system .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 establishes strict proof of identity for all applicants for state-issued driver 's licenses and identification documents .,Republican
this bill serves to protect the integrity of our immigration laws by requiring states  in effect  to confirm lawful immigration status or disclose the lack of confirming identification on the face of cards issued .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 also makes aliens deportable for terrorism-related offenses to the same extent that they would be inadmissible for the same grounds .,Republican
if nothing else  our immigration system must prevent potential terrorists from entering the united states .,Republican
we would not be exercising our responsibility to protect national security if we were to allow our immigration system to be exploited by those malevolent individuals who seek to destroy americans and our way of life .,Republican
mr. chairman  there are many flaws in our immigration system which need to be fixed .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 does not address them all  but it does represent a good step forward in discouraging lawbreaking by those who would choose to exploit our welcoming nature .,Republican
as a cosponsor of the real id act  i urge my colleagues to improve our nation 's security and strengthen our immigration laws by voting for h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the amendment today out of a bit of a sense of confusion as to why we really need to revisit this issue one more time .,Republican
it is odd that in a nation at war that institutions of higher learning would take steps to limit the army and the navy  the marine corps  coast guard and other services ' access to their students .,Republican
i wonder what they are afraid of as to why they would take this particular position .,Republican
they pride themselves on having the brightest in america at their universities  particularly the ones in question .,Republican
as an aside  i was at a university in january  excuse me  in november  at freshman orientation and saw a couple of co-eds walking across campus that obviously have impaired reading skills because they were both smoking .,Republican
nevertheless  i wonder what they are afraid of .,Republican
why are they afraid of the message of serving one 's country  of doing one 's duty .,Republican
we can argue that the federal government should or should not be in a lot of different areas  but clearly national defense and raising an army is a mission of our founding fathers that none of us would argue with .,Republican
i guess the point i would like to make is that if these colleges and universities feel so strongly that their students should not participate in our military  then let us do it with honor and voluntarily turn back the federal funding that supports many of the programs that they support through their universities .,Republican
i would call on them and if they are really serious about limiting this  they are afraid of what our recruiters might say  that our recruiters might ask their young men and women to serve their country  to place their lives on the line  as many of the men and women who today serve our country in those armed forces are doing every day in iraq and afghanistan and other places around the world that we do not necessarily know about  but nevertheless they are serving  why they are afraid of this message ?,Republican
why they do not think their students should have access to that ?,Republican
i rise in support of this resolution and would ask those universities that feel strongly about this to voluntarily send back all the federal funding that they are currently getting and allow us to use those dollars in universities that are a little more in line with the issues that we are talking about today .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from indiana ( mr.,Republican
buyer ) xz4000560  chairman of the committee on veterans ' affairs .,Republican
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am proud to stand here in support of this resolution  a very important resolution introduced by the gentleman from alabama ( mr.,Republican
rogers ) xz4003411 .,Republican
i think we are at a critical period of time in this nation 's history  and it comes a couple of days after one of the more significant  what you would call victories or symbols of what the american military presence is about and what its results are .,Republican
that is  that we pride ourselves in having the best educated  the best trained  the best quality of people serving in all sorts of branches  in all sorts of jobs in the united states military ; and at a time when the world needs this the most from us  it is very important that we maintain that quality .,Republican
i heard the prior speaker talk about the fact that this may be a dangerous place and there are all sorts of other political ideas that may be at play where you could put a recruiter on a campus or not .,Republican
what i would simply say is that that is not the same argument as here .,Republican
this is an argument of fairness and equity .,Republican
it is an argument that says that just because somebody 's political philosophy is counter to the idea that we want to have a strong military presence in this nation  those school administrators  who i think are way off the board in terms of their left-wing views and their antimilitary approach  ought not to be able to ban college military recruiters from doing their job because it is in the national interest that we do it .,Republican
it is really in the world 's interest .,Republican
so i am here to support this resolution and say that what the third circuit did last november again represents the judiciary trying to legislate where it ought not to do it .,Republican
my predecessor  gerry solomon  first introduced this amendment many years back .,Republican
it was that amendment that has been struck down .,Republican
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and recognizing that what we do for the private sector in allowing them to put recruiters in law schools or on any college campus ought to be the same that we do for something so important and so critical as the recruitment of the best and the brightest into our military forces .,Republican
i urge all of my colleagues to strongly support this resolution .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  and i rise  of course  in support of this supplemental .,Republican
i also want to rise to really express my appreciation to the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and the tremendous job he has done in limiting the scope of this supplemental and getting this work done in a quick way  and moving forward on the rest of our appropriations process at the same time .,Republican
these measures can often become reasons not to move forward with the normal work of the house  and the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and his committee and their staff have really accepted double responsibility and double duty by doing these things at the same time .,Republican
this bill does include  as my friend from maryland ( mr.,Republican
hoyer ) xz4001890 mentioned  the embassy compound in baghdad .,Republican
he and i visited the current embassy together in december  and i think we disagree on the need to go ahead and get this project started now .,Republican
the project is 10 percent below the amount of money that the administration asked for .,Republican
it is a substantial amount of money .,Republican
it is a difficult environment  but bidding and starting these projects simply can not happen if we have a little piece of that money to start with ; you have to have the money available so that this embassy can be built and that our people representing us there in the embassy can be secure .,Republican
we had two people killed in the current embassy compound in recent weeks from a missile that was fired there  and we need to move forward .,Republican
in addition to providing vital funding for our troops in fighting the war  this bill also addresses some of the border vulnerabilities identified by the 9/11 commission .,Republican
this legislation does not create a national id card or a national database  but it does move forward in securing our borders and making our asylum process work better to protect americans  both young and old .,Republican
this legislation tightens the asylum system because of that .,Republican
finally  this legislation provides $ 635 million for increased border security and enforcement .,Republican
that includes $ 176 million to hire  train  equip  and support 500 border patrol agents and relieve current facility overcrowding .,Republican
it includes almost half a billion dollars for immigration and customs enforcement  which includes $ 97.5 million to hire and train additional criminal investigators and immigration enforcement agents .,Republican
this bill works to protect our fighting forces abroad  to help secure our borders at home  to move us forward in the war against terror .,Republican
i appreciate the committee 's work on it  and i encourage its approval today .,Republican
mr. chairman  our committee chairman is exactly right ; we can go to page 384 in the 9/11 commission report .,Republican
and i encourage all of my constituents to do this  look at this : `` for terrorists  travel documents are as important as weapons.,Republican
'' and what is the number one travel document ?,Republican
it is a driver 's license .,Republican
it is a huge gaping hole that we have .,Republican
that is why it is imperative that we pass the real id act today and we set a national standard .,Republican
maybe that is just too much common sense for some of my friends that do not want us to do that  but if someone is going to use a travel document as a driver 's license and use it as a way to circumvent our laws and harm our citizens  then it is imperative that we close that loophole .,Republican
having standards that all the states would follow is a great way to close that loophole .,Republican
i would encourage my colleagues to support the real id act .,Republican
i thank the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) for his good work on this issue  and i encourage our constituents to read this report and see the importance of the actions that we are taking today .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding the time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am here to support the rule and encourage this body to move forward with legislation that we have already debated many times in the last congress and legislation that really solves a problem .,Republican
i do suggest that using terms like `` immigrant hater '' does not help this debate .,Republican
this is about border security .,Republican
it is not about those of us who reach out to help immigrants  particularly those immigrants who are here legally and lawfully all the time .,Republican
it is not even about whether they are disadvantaged by people who are here illegally .,Republican
this is about three significant border security issues .,Republican
one is id and clearly id issued by states is important and significant .,Republican
the bipartisan commission that looked into 9/11 dealt specifically with this issue  something that has been overlooked in much of our debate now  the almost-sanctified 9/11 commission .,Republican
that commission said travel documents are as important as weapons and urged the congress to do something about travel documents that did not reflect the true status of individuals .,Republican
in fact  on september 11  driver 's licenses became weapons of mass destruction .,Republican
in the united states today  a driver 's license is all it takes to transfer money to a bank account  to enter a federal building or other vulnerable facility  to board a train or an airplane .,Republican
lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver 's licenses  often multiple licenses from different states .,Republican
in southwest missouri  where i am from and right in the middle of the country  of the 1  387 people who were detained by the office there who were illegally in the country in the year that ended september 30  50 percent of those people had a state-issued driver 's license or state-issued id card  not at all difficult to get .,Republican
of the 19 terrorists on 9/11  they had five dozen driver 's licenses between them and used those driver 's licenses to get on the planes that crashed into the world trade center  the pentagon  and a field in pennsylvania .,Republican
this act would require identity documents to expire at the same time a visa expires  so that someone who is here on an appropriate 6-month visa  as  in fact  much to our amazement  some of the 9/11 terrorists were  are not given a 6-years ' driver 's license when the documents they do produce say they can legally be here for 6 months .,Republican
this bill also tightens the process of applying for asylum in the united states to close loopholes in the system that have been taken advantage of by terrorists .,Republican
this issue was widely debated on the floor last year .,Republican
the example i gave was the terrorist who was here from jordan who had bombed an international school in jordan full of american kids .,Republican
well  that terrorist had not committed a crime in this country and under the current law was allowed to stay here unsupervised in a country full of american kids .,Republican
certainly that is not acceptable .,Republican
that person should have had to have a hearing .,Republican
this legislation requires that .,Republican
i urge that we adopt the rule and the legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman for yielding me this time .,Republican
i am going to support this rules package .,Republican
i was not .,Republican
i came here today fully expecting not to support it ; but because of the action taken last evening where we reconsidered some of the suggestions that had been made  i think we have a package now that we can live with .,Republican
i think some of the recommendations that are in here are ill conceived  and i would hope to work with the chairman again in a bipartisan way with him and his committee and with the leadership to make some additional changes as we go through the process .,Republican
but i want to thank him and thank the speaker and the leadership for accommodating my concerns about some of the amendments that i thought were the most difficult and the ones that created the biggest problem in trying to implement the code of official conduct .,Republican
each of us  in fact all of us  individually and collectively  have a responsibility to maintain the highest standard of conduct for this house .,Republican
and changes in the rules  as was said by the previous speaker  should strengthen  not weaken  those standards .,Republican
as it stands now  i think the previous speaker said we are gutting the ethics committee standards now .,Republican
we are not as it stands now .,Republican
i would not be standing up here encouraging people to support the rules package if in any way i thought we were gutting it .,Republican
we are tweaking it  and as i said earlier  we are tweaking some of it in a way that i wish we were not tweaking it  but it does not gut it .,Republican
it is something that the rules work pretty well the way they are now  and this does not change that that much .,Republican
i have had the privilege of serving on the committee on standards of official conduct since 1997 and have had an additional responsibility as serving as chairman since 2001 .,Republican
and during that time  i have learned one paramount lesson : ethics must be bipartisan .,Republican
the ethics process must be bipartisan .,Republican
ethics reform must be bipartisan  and the ethics committee must be bipartisan .,Republican
and i can tell the members the ethics committee is bipartisan .,Republican
i see our ranking member over here .,Republican
i could not have a better partner in this ethics process than the gentleman from west virginia ( mr.,Republican
mollohan ) xz4002810 .,Republican
the ethics committee is a bipartisan committee that follows the evidence wherever the evidence leads .,Republican
meaningful ethics reform must be genuinely bipartisan .,Republican
to have a bipartisan process  any significant change in the ethics rules must be made only after careful  thorough bipartisan consideration  as was done in 1989 and 1997 .,Republican
in 1989 and 1997  ethics reform came only after a broad consensus developed for change .,Republican
i have always strongly supported reevaluating the ethics rules and procedures and making changes wherever a need is shown .,Republican
i think a number of the criticisms of the ethics process that have been made over the past year are well taken and should be looked at .,Republican
on the other hand  since i joined the committee  almost every significant decision  i believe every significant decision  has been made on a unanimous vote .,Republican
despite the deletion of the amendment that i found the most objectionable to the code of conduct  the rules package includes a number of provisions that would make major changes in the ethics-related rules  but as to which neither the committee on standards of official conduct nor members outside the rules process were consulted .,Republican
while i will not vote against the rules package because of these provisions  i urge the leadership to reconsider all the amendments added to the committee 's procedural rules without a bipartisan process .,Republican
in 1997 the house  through a bipartisan task force  carefully studied the committee on standards of official conduct 's enforcement procedures  made a series of changes .,Republican
the rules package includes provisions that would significantly alter those procedures .,Republican
it would be a mistake to reverse these bipartisan determinations without a bipartisan process of our own .,Republican
the 45-day thing that has been mentioned  i do not like that .,Republican
i think that creates a problem in trying to implement a fair and even-handed ethics process .,Republican
i would like to see that removed .,Republican
when in 1997 the bipartisan task force report was before the house  the house significantly rejected  on a bipartisan vote of 181 to 236  an amendment that would have required automatic dismissal of any complaint after 180 days  not 45 days .,Republican
the reason for rejection of that amendment  as set out in the floor debate  is that such an artificial time limit on the life of a complaint would serve to encourage deadlock within the committee and partisanship among committee members .,Republican
i could go on and on  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
i think that is something we need to look at .,Republican
the ranking member and i and the members of the ethics committee have been considering a group of suggestions that we would like to bring to the full house .,Republican
we would like to do that  mr.,Republican
speaker  shortly after the new session of congress convenes  when we are ready for that process .,Republican
i think that is the way it ought to be done .,Republican
these are the people that struggle with these issues every day .,Republican
i think they ought to be concerned about what we think would make the process better .,Republican
they do not have to follow it  but at least be concerned about it .,Republican
the process in the house is not perfect .,Republican
let us strive to make it perfect .,Republican
on this one issue  let us act together on a bipartisan basis .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in very strong support of the bill  h.r.,Republican
418  and also the very fine amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
sessions ) xz4003670 .,Republican
i spoke on the floor last december in opposition to the conference report on the intelligence bill because it lacked the provisions that we are actually debating here today .,Republican
i commend the leadership of  certainly  the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
sessions ) xz4003670  for bringing this amendment to our attention and adding it to the bill .,Republican
i am very pleased that they made good on their promise that we would be here today providing for the provisions that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 had .,Republican
no issue is more important to this congress than securing our borders and protecting our homeland  and i guarantee it is very important to our constituents .,Republican
when i was in the florida senate  i headed up the homeland security committee shortly after 9/11  and many of the provisions that are in this bill we actually included when we took on the driver 's license issue  making the driver 's licenses only last as long as the person was legally in the country .,Republican
i applaud the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the house leadership for making good on their promise and enacting the recommendations made by the 9/11 commission .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and certainly for the amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
sessions ) xz4003670  which just quite honestly makes common sense in that members ' constituents back home will very easily understand and say  why was this not done a long time ago ?,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
i had a very good discussion with the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) xz4002391 .,Republican
i did not come here to the floor to strike these provisions from the bill .,Republican
i will work with the administration .,Republican
i will work with the committee on appropriations .,Republican
i am going to do that as an authorizer .,Republican
i am not claiming jurisdictional grounds .,Republican
i am not going to play games with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 at all .,Republican
mr. chairman  today i rise to express my concern over a provision in h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
section 102 of this act states that the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive  and shall waive  all laws necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the u.s. border in areas of high illegal entry .,Republican
the provision also bars judicial review of any claim arising from the construction of barriers and roads at borders .,Republican
i understand that this provision is intended to apply primarily to the fence along the border near san diego .,Republican
the construction of that fence is critical to our national security and has been delayed for far too long and i think it is imperative that it be constructed as soon as possible .,Republican
however  i believe the provision currently contained in this bill is far too sweeping .,Republican
it should not be necessary to waive all laws and judicial review relating to the construction of roads and barriers along the border in order to complete the fence near san diego .,Republican
i hope that as the bill moves forward we can find a solution that will lead to the swift construction of this fence without sweeping away important laws .,Republican
i thought what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) did by making a performance of duty was a wise thing .,Republican
i think that was a wise move of the gentleman .,Republican
i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) did is followed what we  the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Republican
evans ) and i  had also recommended .,Republican
performance of duty is a good thing .,Republican
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Republican
i do not have a problem with the performance of duty .,Republican
i have come to the floor to express some concerns with regard to the identification of an insurance product .,Republican
we are turning it into an indemnity and a gratuity with regard to an insurance product .,Republican
we have to be smart about our business with regard to how we proceed .,Republican
that is my purpose of being here .,Republican
it is not to reach into the treasury and just say we are going to give this money out .,Republican
but it does and i gave the example because you can have someone who has an accidental death or a duty nonperformance in the service .,Republican
mr. chairman  i have some concerns about provisions in section 1113 of the bill relating to service members group life insurance  which i will now referral to as sgli .,Republican
neither the department of veterans affairs nor the house committee on veterans ' affairs  the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over va insurance programs  was consulted prior to the administration 's submitting the insurance proposals in the war supplemental .,Republican
i recognize that it placed the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) xz4002391 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 in very difficult positions  because they always come to the floor to talk about authorizing on appropriations bills ; but that is what you are doing exactly here .,Republican
there are two primary points of concern with regard to these sections .,Republican
number one  it would authorize retroactive insurance coverage in cases of servicemembers who die having declined insurance coverage ; and  second  it would require a spouse to concur with the servicemember 's insurance coverage election .,Republican
the administration proposed to provide for a retroactive payment to give the same level of benefits proposed for prospective maximum sgli to those who have died since the beginning of combat operations on october 7  2001 .,Republican
at the appropriations markup  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 offered an amendment  which was accepted  to limit retroactive payment to those who died in performance of duty .,Republican
by restricting payments to deaths that the service secretary concerned determines in the performance of duty  we would then expect that deaths which occurred during the performance of an assigned military duty would be compensated  but that deaths not associated with assigned military duties would not qualify .,Republican
another qualifier  though  that perhaps should have been considered during this markup  would have been in addition to dying in performance of military duties  the servicemember must have had maximum insurance coverage at the time of death .,Republican
the committee on veterans ' affairs has established a record in this regard .,Republican
when we increased the sgli coverage from $ 200  000 to $ 250  000 with a delayed effective date in public law 106-419  then in reaction to the terrorist attack on the uss cole we did  in fact  make a retroactivity in public law 107-14 for servicemembers who died in performance of duty that had maximum sgli at the time of their death .,Republican
we should not be providing the maximum amount of insurance posthumously if the servicemember declined coverage  hence  never paid premiums  or elected a lesser amount .,Republican
this is a policy change that could have detrimental effects .,Republican
the bottom line is that it changes the identity and substance of the sgli program .,Republican
sgli is neither an indemnity nor a gratuity program .,Republican
it is an insurance program .,Republican
second  i have great concern regarding the administration 's proposal to include in h.r.,Republican
1268 that a spouse must concur with a servicemember 's insurance election .,Republican
life insurance is a contract .,Republican
requiring a spouse who is not a party to the contract to assent to a servicemember 's decision concerning whether to enter into a contract and the amount of that contract violates the principles of contractual law and the nature of life insurance .,Republican
requiring the spouse to concur with the servicemember 's decision  as included in h.r.,Republican
1268  would in fact make sgli a volunteer program for single servicemembers  and an involuntary program for married servicemembers .,Republican
life insurance policies are fundamentally different from the protection to surviving spouses rightfully provided under some other retirement programs .,Republican
there are plenty of substantive concerns with regard to this provision : one  giving the spouse veto power over the amount of insurance that gives him or her greater say than the servicemember .,Republican
number two  sgli would in fact be a voluntary program for singles  involuntary for married .,Republican
three  the concurrence policy would force the servicemember to pay premiums and keep the spouse as a beneficiary  even in situations of pending divorce  spousal abuse  drug abuse  child abuse .,Republican
i mean  let your mind go .,Republican
fourth  the spousal concurrence as drafted in the bill would prevent a servicemember from naming children  children from a previous marriage  parents  grandparents  guardians of grandchildren  let your mind go  from participating in insurance .,Republican
the supreme court has upheld the right of the insured to name whoever he or she wants as a beneficiary  even if it is in violation of a state court divorce decree .,Republican
there are administrative concerns as well  the substantial administrative costs that would be added in the day-to-day running of this program  as well as has been added to its greater complexity .,Republican
if a servicemember there says that there is no spouse or names another beneficiary and declines coverage  a spouse could come forward after the servicemember 's death .,Republican
another concern is the program may be liable to pay maximum amounts if no premiums were collected or if a separate beneficiary already had been paid .,Republican
and if there is a delay in getting a spouse to agree to insurance coverage or the amount and the servicemember dies  then who receives the benefits ?,Republican
these are many  many issues that need to be resolved  and i look forward to working with the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) as we proceed forward to the conference to address many of these issues .,Republican
mr. chairman  i include the following letter from the military officers association of america for the record .,Republican
of america  alexandria  va  march 11  2005 .,Republican
dear mr .,Republican
chairman : on behalf of the 370  000 members of the military officers association of america ( moaa )  i am writing to inform you that  after discussing the issue extensively with the committee 's majority and minority staff  moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen 's group life insurance ( sgli ) spousal consent requirement  as included in the appropriations committee 's markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act .,Republican
we believe there is merit to the staff 's view that the appropriations committee 's language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ' ability to make reasonable insurance decisions -- especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse .,Republican
moaa believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act  and we have no wish to slow that process in any way .,Republican
therefore  moaa urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification ( instead of spousal consent ) or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another appropriate legislative venue .,Republican
sincerely  colonel  usaf ( ret ) ,Republican
no  the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
i will be more than happy to get the gentleman legal counsel so he can understand what he has written .,Republican
i thank the gentleman .,Republican
what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) did with regard to performance -- --,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
i believe that the performance of duty that is in the bill  what it does  it does identify with regard to who will receive payment and who do not receive payments .,Republican
that was why i used the word `` limited '' or `` restricted '' because you could have an individual  mr.,Republican
chairman  of whom died in an auto accident  was murdered  or something happened to them and they do not qualify .,Republican
absolutely .,Republican
that is why what we have here are two individuals of whom understand what we are talking about but probably have a  well  anyway  let us not use semantics .,Republican
what i do wish to do as we proceed forward as we go to conference working with the senate is work also with the administration  work with the department of defense  the va and omb to make sure that we bring a proper identity with regard to service and group life insurance that also subsidizes veterans group life insurance  and that is what i want to work with the chairman on .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in support of the rule on h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
our nation 's immigration policy has been of top concern in recent years  and for good reason .,Republican
with between eight and twelve million illegal aliens in the united states  it is obviously a problem out of control .,Republican
we need to increase border security and fix our immigration laws .,Republican
we need a system that will encourage well-intentioned  contributing aliens out of the shadows and allow them to pay a reasonable penalty so they can come into compliance with the law .,Republican
americans are rightly concerned about the security and the integrity of the nation 's borders because the system is broken .,Republican
some are concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing our borders and coming into our cities .,Republican
but we can not effectively fight terrorism if we fail to make the distinction between them and busboys and housekeepers .,Republican
from 1990 to 2000  the number of u.s. border patrol agents nearly tripled  but illegal immigration increased by as much as 5.5 million .,Republican
increasing enforcement resources to keep out willing immigrant workers  as we did throughout the 1990s  has not worked .,Republican
it has failed  and we need enforcement to be much more narrowly focused on criminals and potential terrorists .,Republican
today  we are considering h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
this legislation begins the debate on the enforcement aspects of immigration and addresses the narrow issue of driver license security .,Republican
i have reservations about the gradual move toward what could become a national id card  but this legislation begins to address issues necessary to focus efforts in enforcement .,Republican
mr. speaker  i intend to vote in favor of h.r.,Republican
418  but while doing so  i suggest that enforcement  border security and immigration reform must be worked on together .,Republican
in fact  fixing the broken system requires a broader strategy that includes both enforcement and the creation of adequate legal channels for immigration that serve the nation 's interests .,Republican
by creating legal channels for those looking for a better life and looking to fill jobs that americans will not fill  we enhance our enforcement efforts .,Republican
the responsible authorities can focus their resources first on the worst actors .,Republican
our immigration laws and policies must reflect the realities we face today .,Republican
our economy demands workers  but our national security demands that we identify those lurking in the shadows .,Republican
enhanced enforcement must be the top priority for immigration policy .,Republican
the american people are not anti-immigrant .,Republican
we are concerned about the lack of coherence in our immigration policy and enforcement .,Republican
as part of today 's debate  we must realize that the congress needs to address the other issues with immigration reform now .,Republican
broader immigration reform has been outlined by president bush .,Republican
i commend him for his act of leadership .,Republican
he has outlined the solution and now congress must act quickly in crafting legislation .,Republican
this bill is our first step in a long journey to restore public confidence in an open  welcoming immigration code .,Republican
let us give thanks to our immigrants when b.c .,Republican
forbes sailed for america from scotland in 1904  he was following a course well worn by generations of scots .,Republican
i know how the founder of forbes magazine must have felt .,Republican
the murdochs originally hail from the same part of scotland .,Republican
today  we are part of the most recent wave of immigrants attracted by the bright beacon of american liberty .,Republican
these days  it 's not always easy to talk about the benefits of immigration .,Republican
especially since 9/11  many americans worry about borders and security .,Republican
these are legitimate concerns .,Republican
but surely a nation as great as america has the wit and resources to distinguish between those who come here to destroy the american dream -- and the many millions more who come to live it .,Republican
the evidence of the contributions these immigrants make to our society is all around us -- especially in the critical area of education .,Republican
adam smith  another scotsman  knew that without a decent system of education  a modem capitalist society was committing suicide .,Republican
well  our modern public school systems simply are not producing the talent the american economy needs to compete in the future .,Republican
and it often seems that it is our immigrants who are holding the whole thing up .,Republican
in a study on high school students released this past summer  the national foundation for american policy found 60 percent of the top science students  and 65 percent of the top math students  are children of immigrants .,Republican
the same study found that seven of the top award winners at the 2004 intel science talent search were immigrants or children of immigrants .,Republican
this correlates with other findings that more than half of engineers -- and 45 percent of math and computer scientists -- with ph,Republican
d.s now working in the u.s. are foreign born .,Republican
it 's not just the statistics .,Republican
you see it at our most elite college and university campuses  where asian immigrants or their children are disproportionately represented .,Republican
and a recent study of 28 prestigious american universities by researchers from princeton and the university of pennsylvania found something startling : that 41 percent of the black students attending these schools described themselves as either immigrants or children of immigrants .,Republican
the point is that by almost any measure of educational excellence you choose  if you 're in america you 're going to find immigrants or their children at the top .,Republican
i do n't just mean engineers and scientists and technicians .,Republican
in my book  anyone who comes here and gives an honest day 's work for an honest day 's pay is not only putting himself closer to the american dream  he 's helping the rest of us get there too .,Republican
as ronald reagan said at the statue of liberty  `` while we applaud those immigrants who stand out  whose contributions are easily discerned  we know that america 's heroes are also those whose names are remembered by only a few.,Republican
'' let me share some of these names with you .,Republican
start with eddie chin  an ethnic chinese marine who was born a week after his family fled burma .,Republican
you 've all seen cpl .,Republican
chin .,Republican
because when baghdad fell  he was the marine we all watched shimmy up the statue of saddam hussein to attach the cable that would pull it down .,Republican
or lance cpl .,Republican
ahmad ibrahim .,Republican
his family came to the u.s. from syria when the first gulf war broke out .,Republican
now cpl .,Republican
ibrahim hopes to be deployed to iraq -- also as a marine -- to put his arabic language skills in the service of corps and country .,Republican
or what about cpl .,Republican
jos gutierrez  who was raised in guatemala and came to america as a boy -- illegally !,Republican
cpl .,Republican
gutierrez was one of the first marines killed in action in iraq .,Republican
as his family told reporters  this young immigrant enlisted with the marine corps because he wanted to `` give back '' to america .,Republican
so here we have it -- asian marines  arab marines  latino marines -- all united in the mission of protecting the rest of us .,Republican
is n't this what reagan meant when he said that the bond that ties our immigrants together -- what makes us a nation instead of a collection of individuals -- is `` an abiding love of liberty '' ?,Republican
so the next time you hear people whining about what a `` drain '' on america our immigrants are  it might be worth asking if they consider these marines a drain .,Republican
maybe this is more clear to businessmen because of what we see every day .,Republican
my company  news corporation  is a multinational company based in america .,Republican
our diversity is based on talent  cooperation and ability .,Republican
frankly it does n't bother me in the least that millions of people are attracted to our shores .,Republican
what we should worry about is the day they no longer find these shores attractive .,Republican
in an era when too many of our pundits declare that the american dream is a fraud  it is america 's immigrants who remind us -- by dint of their success -- that the dream is alive  and well within reach of anyone willing to work for it .,Republican
we are fortunate to have a president who understands that .,Republican
only a few days ago  the white house indicated that it intended to revive an immigration reform which the president had first offered before 9/11 and tried to revive back in january .,Republican
politically speaking  a guest-worker plan is no easy thing .,Republican
but as president bush realizes  we 'll never fix the problem of illegal immigration simply by throwing up walls and trying to make all of us police them .,Republican
we 've tried that for a decade or so now  and it 's been a flop .,Republican
what we need to do first is to make it easier for those who seek honest work to do so without having to disobey our laws .,Republican
fundamentally that means recognizing that an economy as powerful as ours is always going to have a demand for more workers .,Republican
such a policy would benefit us all : it would help those who want nothing more than to work legally move out of the shadows .,Republican
it would help our security forces stop wasting resources now spent on hunting down mexican waitresses and start devoting them to tracking the terrorists who really threaten us .,Republican
it would help the economy by providing america with the labor and talent it needs .,Republican
given the tremendous pressures on president bush and the considerable opposition from within his own ranks  the politically expedient thing for him to do would be to drop it .,Republican
but he has n't  and i for one am encouraged by his refusal to give in .,Republican
the immigrant editor b.c .,Republican

we who have arrived more recently likewise will never forget our debt we owe to this land -- and the obligation to keep that same opportunity alive in the 21st .,Republican
mr. murdoch is chairman and chief executive of news corporation .,Republican
this is adapted from a speech he gave last thursday  in acceptance of the 2004 b.c .,Republican
forbes award .,Republican
immigration reform : a 3-legged stool while not a major theme of last fall 's campaign  a debate on immigration reform will be front and center in the early days of the new bush administration .,Republican
early last year  president bush acknowledged that our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed .,Republican
for this he deserves credit .,Republican
recognizing that there is a problem is a critical first step toward finding a solution .,Republican
in the past 10 years  more than $ 20 billion has been spent on adding border patrol agents  building fencing and employing technology to prevent border crossings .,Republican
during roughly the same period  however  estimates on the net number of undocumented entering the country have risen from about 300  000 per year to about 500  000 per year .,Republican
more disturbing is that  in the past five years  more than 2  000 migrants have lost their lives perishing in remote portions of the american southwest .,Republican
and yet those who survive the gauntlet of a dangerous border crossing find work in short order .,Republican
our economy needs their manpower : the labor department projects that  by the year 2008  there will be 6 million more low-skilled jobs available than americans able to fill them .,Republican
at the same time  these workers contribute billions to the tax and social security systems .,Republican
truth be told  our current system  instead of discouraging undocumented migration  makes it inevitable because adequate provisions in law do not exist to match up willing workers from other countries with unfilled jobs here .,Republican
work visas for unskilled workers are absurdly small compared to the demand -- 5  000 in the permanent system and up to 66  000 in the temporary one .,Republican
family-unity visas can be even scarcer  with waiting times as long as 10 years for mexican families to be reunited with a relative who is a u.s. citizen or legal resident .,Republican
we need immigration reform legislation with three major components  akin to a three-legged stool .,Republican
the administration plan proposed last january addresses only one leg -- employment -- which is insufficient to support the weight on the system .,Republican
first  any new proposal should feature means for undocumented long-term residents to access permanent residency .,Republican
legalization does not necessarily mean amnesty .,Republican
it can be conditioned on any number of criteria including -- for example  `` sweat equity '' the undocumented have already accrued through their work in the united states .,Republican
such a legal remedy would stabilize both immigrant families and the labor force .,Republican
second  it should reform the employment-based legal immigration system in a way that increases legal avenues to work while protecting the rights of both foreign-born and u.s. workers .,Republican
this would permit future flows of workers to enter safely and legally and reduce deaths at the border .,Republican
third  the plan should shorten waiting times under the family reunification system .,Republican
too often  our current system separates husbands from wives and parents from children  a morally unacceptable outcome in a nation built upon the strength of the family .,Republican
anti-immigrant polemicists ignore the human tragedy and familial dislocation enabled by the status quo  while discounting the invaluable contributions immigrants make to our nation .,Republican
americans are  as a whole  fair-minded people .,Republican
we can not continue to accept the benefits of undocumented laborers but be unwilling to extend to them the protection of the law .,Republican
the undocumented are not `` breaking '' the law as much as they are being `` broken '' by the law .,Republican
after our country 's unhappy experience with jim crow `` laws '' that resulted in the creation of a large black underc1ass  we should not repeat the same mistake in tolerating the creation of a large immigrant underc1ass by not affording legal remedies that would afford them the protection of law and the opportunity for upward mobility .,Republican
we applaud the president for recognizing how the present immigration regime hurts both americans and undocumented immigrants in america .,Republican
the new congress should work with president bush to enact a comprehensive solution to our immigration crisis .,Republican
only such a `` three-legged '' comprehensive approach will protect human rights and prepare our nation for the challenges of the future .,Republican
for doable policy resolving the dilemma posed by many millions of `` undocumented '' workers in america requires compromise that few will find completely satisfying .,Republican
temporary work permits will please neither those who want all illegal immigrants deported nor those who want another round of amnesty .,Republican
amnesty is politically untenable  and deporting millions of people is not doable .,Republican
it would require enormous amounts of money and manpower from a government that is already strapped to meet current social obligations and international commitments .,Republican
president bush told reporters recently that he wants u.s. border patrol agents chasing `` crooks and thieves and drug-runners and terrorists  not good-hearted people who are coming here to work.,Republican
'' the president is seeking levelheaded immigration legislation that could improve domestic security and put policy in line with the needs of the globalized american economy .,Republican
the most sensible approach would offer legitimacy to those who have worked diligently in america  while imposing and enforcing tough employer sanctions against companies that continue to employ undocumented workers .,Republican
this would weaken the so-called magnet effect that lures otherwise law-abiding people to jump the border .,Republican
such a policy requires several key provisions .,Republican
one would obligate illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows to prove their identities in return for some form of legitimate status .,Republican
this type of trade-off serves u.s. interests by identifying those who are here `` to work  '' as the president has said .,Republican
bringing them out of the woodwork would allow law enforcement agents to focus more sharply on catching those who are here to do harm .,Republican
a reform bill should take into account the brainpower needs of the u.s. economy .,Republican
there are untold numbers of people around the world who are standing in line to legally enter the united states  and many of these would-be immigrants possess skills that american employers need .,Republican
since the sept .,Republican
11 attacks  this process has become cumbersome and counterproductive .,Republican
immigration reform should streamline the process for granting skilled foreigners access to the united states  particularly those well-suited for workplaces that have a tough time finding qualified hands .,Republican
there 's no reason the united states ca n't have a policy that promotes safety while meeting the needs of the workplace .,Republican
congress and the white house can find suitable resolutions to the security  social and labor quandaries posed by immigration if prejudices and stigmas are shoved aside in favor of rational proposals that bolster u.s. security and global competitiveness .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would like to submit a statement for the record from the americans for tax reform .,Republican
february 9  2005 .,Republican
our nation 's immigration and border control policies cry out for reform .,Republican
while our best border control officers should be preventing the next terrorist incursion into our country  they are instead hunting down willing workers .,Republican
the attacks of september 11th called for new and updated thinking in all areas of federal law enforcement  and immigration reform has been a glaring omission .,Republican
america 's immigration system must be reformed in a responsible  welcoming  adult manner along the lines laid out by president bush .,Republican
willing workers should be matched with willing employers  citizenship and residency applications must be streamlined  and the focus must shift to protecting the nation from terrorists .,Republican
border security has been increased since 9/11  and should continue to be so .,Republican
the latest technology must be used to make sure america 's border is free of terrorist incursions .,Republican
in order to let the border guard do their job of defending america  the president supports giving foreign laborers guest worker cards  `` to match willing workers with willing employers.,Republican
'' president bush is opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants .,Republican
he also does not want to give foreigners in the guest worker program any advantage over those who are trying to become citizens through normal  due process channels .,Republican
congress should support president bush 's common-sense plan to reform and strengthen america 's broken immigration system even as border security is addressed today in the house of representatives .,Republican
grover norquist ,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself 1 minute  because i think the gentlewoman from texas has made some very valid points that need to be discussed .,Republican
one thing that is important and what we have done here is to understand that there has to be a conviction in this situation by a court of law before it can be entered into a database of the transportation security administration .,Republican
that is very important .,Republican
it gives all the protection of what could happen there .,Republican
we thought a lot about that because it was a matter of some concern .,Republican
so a mere allegation or something that proves not to be true would never be entered into the database .,Republican
i wanted to make that point .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from connecticut ( mr.,Republican
shays ) xz4003700 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today to voice my strong support for h.r.,Republican
1268  the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense  the global war on terror  and tsunami relief .,Republican
this essential legislation will support and defend america 's values both at home and abroad .,Republican
our troops serving in iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts in iraq and to continue the war on terror .,Republican
at home  the real id provisions will strengthen our nation 's driver 's license laws  providing each citizen with another layer of security .,Republican
until now  terrorists could easily exploit weak driver licensing laws and obtain fake documents .,Republican
with a license in hand  terrorists were better able to blend in  avoid detection  and harm our nation 's citizens .,Republican
this is exactly what several of the 9/11 terrorists did  using drivers ' licenses to board airplanes and murder thousands of innocent americans on september 11  2001 .,Republican
we in congress have been working on ways to prevent our nation from experiencing another terrorist attack by establishing stronger and more secure national programs .,Republican
stronger driver 's license standards made possible by the real id provisions will be another step towards american security .,Republican
the real id provisions will close dangerous gaps that remain in our current licensing law and that allow terrorists to abuse our asylum and driver 's license systems .,Republican
the new law will protect innocent americans by setting up national driver 's license standards  networking state motor vehicle data bases  and linking visa and license expirations .,Republican
in 2003  the former attorney general of virginia  jerry kilgore  and i worked together on the driver 's license integrity act .,Republican
that legislation required non-immigrant aliens to show their visas when applying for state identification and tied the expiration date of the identification to that of the visa .,Republican
due to mr.,Republican
kilgore 's leadership on this issue  the commonwealth of virginia was one of the first states to clamp down on terrorists ' abuse of the trust that a driver 's license conveys .,Republican
today  i am pleased to see virginia 's driver 's license integrity act provisions in this piece of legislation before us in the house of representatives .,Republican
since the beginning of the war on terror  congress has fought daily to ensure that our nation never again suffers at the hands of terrorists .,Republican
the provisions in this bill provide us with more weapons in our arsenal against terrorism .,Republican
i urge passage of this legislation .,Republican
yes .,Republican
if the gentlewoman will yield further  it speaks very specifically to trial and conviction .,Republican
mr. chairman  i congratulate the chairman and the committee on government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action on and take action on now .,Republican
of course we need to do this .,Republican
of course we need to pass the real id act .,Republican
because as the chairman just said  certainly all of us who board planes want to know that there is some integrity to our id system in this country and that terrorists are not boarding planes by the use of a state-issued identification card .,Republican
this is not conjecture .,Republican
this is what happened on 9/11 .,Republican
this is what the 9/11 commission suggested that we take action on  and this is what we are here doing today .,Republican
as the chairman suggested  i am proud to say that in 2003 virginia  under the leadership of former attorney general jerry kilgore  acted to close this dangerous loophole .,Republican
the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law a provision which requires the minimum standard  which says that anyone applying for a license in virginia must have legal status in this country ; that they must have a visa ; and that the license that would be issued would coterminate with the termination or expiration of that visa .,Republican
this is just common sense .,Republican
why do we want terrorists to have a license issued by a state to go and board our airplanes and commandeer those airplanes into a building ?,Republican
it is time for congress to act  to provide and mandate a minimum standard for states when they issue state ids  including driver 's licenses  to require that individuals who have that privilege be here in this country legally .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
tom davis ) for his leadership on this  and i urge passage of the real id act .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise to offer a simple amendment to the very thorough legislation before us today .,Republican
the gentleman from wisconsin 's ( chairman sensenbrenner ) dedication to fixing gaps in our security is commendable  and i am proud to join him in strengthening federal identity requirements  protecting those who need political asylum  and improving our border security .,Republican
the 9/11 commission identified gates for boarding airplanes is the last opportunity for our screeners to use sources of identification to ensure that people are who they say they are  and frankly  obviously  to check whether they are terrorists .,Republican
to improve this process  congress tasked the department of homeland security with the goal of developing and building upon the aviation watch lists that our screeners commonly rely upon today .,Republican
my amendment is intended to enhance the information contained in homeland security 's aviation security screening databases and to ensure that our security is not compromised through the use of falsified driver 's licenses .,Republican
specifically  the amendment would require homeland security to enter into the appropriate database any person convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane .,Republican
currently  aviation screeners at the transportation security administration immediately detain individuals suspected of presenting false driver 's licenses and then turn them over to the custody of either the department of justice or local authorities .,Republican
the criminal justice system is then responsible for determining whether the suspect is guilty or innocent .,Republican
under the present system  if convicted  this person is sentenced to federally mandated punishment  but the department of homeland security is not required to put their name on a watch list .,Republican
my amendment would go a step further in protecting our nation by also requiring the department to enter a violator into one of its national aviation screening databases .,Republican
improving the quantity and quality of information contained in these passenger-screening databases is essential to enhancing our ability to identify potential threats and prevent terrorists from gaining access to our airliners .,Republican
when a person is convicted of trying to deceive security to get on an airplane  there is serious cause for alarm .,Republican
my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane would be red-flagged for airport screeners .,Republican
the amendment does not impact persons who use false driver 's licenses for other purposes .,Republican
it allows the criminal justice system to run its course  and it is focused solely on the last line of defense before terrorists board an airplane .,Republican
it is a simple  cost-effective way to enhance the department of homeland security 's ability to track potential high-risk passengers .,Republican
again  i appreciate the opportunity to offer a small but important step in improving our security databases .,Republican
my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane are red-flagged for airport screeners .,Republican
the people screening passengers at the gates do their best to make sure terrorists are not getting on these planes .,Republican
congress should do everything in our power to make their job easier .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the real id act  and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner )  for his efforts in this matter .,Republican
it is very important .,Republican
this bill is about common sense .,Republican
it is about protecting our borders and making our country safer .,Republican
the 9/11 commission report revealed many disconcerting facts  none more unnerving than the fact that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers who were here temporarily obtained valid driver 's licenses  enabling them to travel freely about the country .,Republican
that is absurd  and the american people know it .,Republican
this bill finally does something about that absurdity .,Republican
we can not continue to let our laws be exploited and circumvented by future terrorists to further their plans of violence  destruction  and murder .,Republican
with the real id act in place  we can better prevent future tragic events from occurring .,Republican
mr. chairman  i urge my colleagues to pass this critical piece of legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  if the gentlewoman would yield further  no  i would not have objected to having hearings .,Republican
it is relatively simple .,Republican
i do not mean to suggest it needs panels of hearings  but i never object to having a hearing .,Republican
mr. chairman  i believe the gentlewoman from texas ( ms.,Republican
jackson-lee ) xz4001990 has the right to close ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his tireless efforts and leadership in getting the real id act to the floor and for championing national security issues and the crisis we face today with our nation 's border security .,Republican
i would also like to thank my colleagues in the southern california delegation for their efforts and for helping to protect not only their districts  but also the nation 's borders as well .,Republican
san diego border fence : for too long our nation has been playing chicken with our national security by ignoring the need to take a comprehensive approach to border security issues  particularly as they pertain to the mexican border .,Republican
the mexican border has long been a porous and unguarded route for anyone wishing to sneak into the united states to inflict harm on our nation and our citizens  including terrorists .,Republican
in particular  the san diego sector covers an area of more than 7  000 square miles and 66 miles of international border with mexico .,Republican
beyond that section of the border are the mexican cities of tijuana and tecate  which boasts a combined population of more than 2 million people .,Republican
this area of the border has been a heavily traveled route for illegal immigrants and potential terrorists due to the major cities and transportation hubs  such as lax airport in los angeles .,Republican
this area alone accounts for nearly 50 percent of national apprehensions of illegal immigrants nationwide .,Republican
a significant number of illegal immigrants that have been apprehended in this area can be directly attributed to the san diego fence that was constructed a few years ago .,Republican
the san diego fence is a project that was started several years ago  but a 3.5-mile section of the fence was not completed due to environmental concerns .,Republican
the portions of the san diego fence that have been built have proven to be successful and are credited with significant declines in attempted border crossings in that area .,Republican
the existing fence needs improvements and must be extended 3.5 miles to its originally planned length .,Republican
this legislation puts those priorities front and center by granting the secretary of homeland security the authority to waive all federal laws in order to complete the fence .,Republican
in addition  this bill will increase the funding to improve the existing fence with a 3-tiered fence system and complete the original designed length .,Republican
while environmental issues plays an appropriate role in our nations ' policies  the environmental and national security impacts of having illegal immigrants trample this portion of the border is greater than the concerns regarding building and completing the fence .,Republican
lastly  recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with alien smuggling rings in order to enter the united states  particularly through the southern border with mexico .,Republican
the time to act on the san diego border fence is now .,Republican
drivers ' license : real id act also bolsters stronger security standards for the issuance of drivers ' licenses to aliens .,Republican
this bill will establish requirements that help prove lawful presence in the united states prior to issuing a license to individuals .,Republican
in addition  it is critical that all states must comply to eliminate weak links in the domestic identity security .,Republican
we have all seen the failures of cards such as the matriculate consular cards and the widespread fraud that can take place .,Republican
this bill requires tough physical security requirements to reduce counterfeiting and to ensure state compliance with such standards .,Republican
lastly  drivers ' licenses that are issued in compliance with the new regulations will expire when an alien 's visa expires to alleviate any confusion or ability for terrorists asylum provisions : finally  the real id act will tighten the asylum system that has been abused and gamed by terrorists for years .,Republican
this bill allows judges to determine a witnesses ' credibility in their asylum cases .,Republican
without this change  judges have no discretion in determining the credibility of witnesses testifying that they are being persecuted .,Republican
judge 's hands have been tied over the years and must just grant asylum in every case where persecution has been raised and have not been able to go beyond that point .,Republican
this has allowed terrorists who have been persecuted in their home country for being terrorists to seek shelter in the united states .,Republican
currently  this argument can not be used against them and is not grounds for deportation .,Republican
this bill gives the power to refuse terrorists entry to the united states and allows terrorists to be deported back to their home country .,Republican
terrorists have long been abusing our system in order to gain entry .,Republican
this bill provides a list of long-accepted commonsense factors that an immigration judge can consider in assessing credibility  such as the demeanor  candor  responsiveness and consistency of an asylum applicant or other witness .,Republican
it is essential for judges to be able to determine asylum cases based on the credibility or lack of credibility of witnesses .,Republican
again  i would to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his efforts in getting this bill to the floor and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill because these reforms are necessary to our national security .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i am happy to join this debate as the chairman of the committee on homeland security and welcome the gentleman from mississippi ( mr.,Republican
thompson )  my ranking member .,Republican
we are here because each day thousands of people illegally enter the united states .,Republican
they know where to cross .,Republican
they know how to get a driver 's license .,Republican
and if they are caught  they even know how to rig our legal system to stay in the country nonetheless .,Republican
what has been the result of this broken system ?,Republican
on january 25  1993  mir aimal kansi stood at the entrance of the central intelligence agency and gunned down five people .,Republican
a month later ramzi yousef masterminded the first bombing of the world trade center .,Republican
both men were in the country because they were awaiting the outcome of their asylum applications .,Republican
this legislation will fix that loophole .,Republican
on september 11  2001  according to the 9/11 commission report  the 19 hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks carried between them 13 u.s. driver 's licenses and 21 state-issued id cards .,Republican
several of these hijackers had overstayed their visas  and they were unlawfully in this country .,Republican
but their driver 's licenses permitted them to board those airplanes nonetheless .,Republican
this bill fixes that problem .,Republican
the laws that we are operating under today allow terrorists to enter our country and to plan and carry out attacks in the united states .,Republican
the reality is that this homeland security vulnerability is being exploited by terrorists and criminal aliens every day .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 makes necessary changes to ensure that terrorists do not obtain identification  as did the 9/11 hijackers  that will permit them to board airplanes or access federal facilities or easily travel within the united states .,Republican
the most literal security gap that this bill addresses is the 3-mile hole in the san diego border fence .,Republican
recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with human smuggling rings in order to enter the united states .,Republican
as we now know  the 9/11 hijackers were interviewed 25 times by u.s. consular officers ; they had 43 contacts with immigration and customs authorities .,Republican
but because of administration and congressional initiatives requiring the screening of all foreign nationals entering the united states  terrorists will be forced to resort to crossing our borders illegally .,Republican
the border security fence  therefore  which thus far has been mired in bureaucratic delays  is part of our national security efforts and must be completed now .,Republican
for decades the border between san diego and mexico has been the preferred corridor for entry into the united states by unknown or undocumented persons .,Republican
with highly populated cities both north and south of the border as well as relatively quick access to national transportation hubs such as lax  it is the perfect place for aliens to slip across the border and gain quick access to u.s. communities and transportation networks .,Republican
the important infrastructure assets in the area  including in particular the largest naval base on the west coast of the united states and the busiest seaport in the united states  makes securing this area even more important .,Republican
from september through november  2004  the border patrol apprehended over 23  000 individuals with criminal records including 84 wanted for murder and 151 wanted for sexual assault .,Republican
in 2004 border patrol agents arrested almost 1.2 million illegal aliens with 11.6 percent of those apprehended in the san diego sector alone  despite the fact that the san diego sector is roughly 1 percent of our border area .,Republican
over the past 2 years  the three border patrol stations responsible for patrol of the existing 14 miles of border fence in the san diego sector have apprehended approximately 200 special interest aliens annually from countries such as afghanistan  iran  iraq  pakistan  and turkey .,Republican
completion of this fence will not only reduce the number of illegal crossings in the area but will also allow the border patrol to redeploy manpower and redirect precious resources to other important homeland security missions along the border .,Republican
and like the other border fence areas  the san diego sector can expect to see a reduction in crime  including murder  as well .,Republican
of the 14 miles authorized by congress several times  9 miles of the triple fence have been completed .,Republican
but only in washington would people construct a fence with a big hole in it .,Republican
the final 3 1/2 miles has been held up due to bureaucratic red tape and lawsuits .,Republican
the border patrol has worked to alleviate the environmental concerns that have been raised .,Republican
in fact  the u.s. department of the interior 's fish and wildlife service concluded in july  2003  that construction of the fence `` is not likely to jeopardize '' the continued existence of any relevant endangered species in the area .,Republican
furthermore  not completing the fence will continue to cause other environmental damage in the area due to large numbers of persons crossing illegally through this area and subsequent pursuit by the border patrol  as well as large amounts of trash and refuse left in the wake of smugglers and illegal crossers .,Republican
as chairman of the committee on homeland security and a california resident  i am extremely concerned by the roadblocks that different bureaucratic groups have used to justify thwarting this important project .,Republican
for example  in september of 2003  the san diego border patrol requested entry to a section of county-owned land located in the 3 1/2 mile section in dispute and located about 300 feet from the u.s.-mexican border in order to  first  improve the road for safety of the border patrol agents ; and  two  take soil samples in order to address environmental concerns pertaining to construction of the fence .,Republican
but the san diego county department of parks and recreation denied access  saying there was no authority to enter upon the land .,Republican
after months of negotiation  i have been told that the issue was finally resolved  but this clearly demonstrates that federal action is necessary to ensure that the fence is completed and that border security remains a priority .,Republican
the time for delay and bureaucratic obstruction is over .,Republican
we must complete this fence  and we must pass h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield the balance of our time to the distinguished majority leader  the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
delay ) xz4001040 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent that debate be extended for 1 additional minute  to be divided equally between majority and minority .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
kolbe ) xz4002260 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  several provisions in this legislation are of particular interest to the committee on homeland security .,Republican
first  this spending bill will be procedurally consolidated with the real id act  which the house approved 261-161 on february 10  2005 .,Republican
we can not effectively fight terrorism if we can not verify the identity of people boarding airplanes  entering nuclear power plants  visiting the white house  or gaining access to any of the countless places a terrorist could use as a stage to multiply the effect of an attack .,Republican
accurate identification of individuals before permitting them access to critical infrastructure is a prerequisite to success .,Republican
the failure to ensure the integrity of identification documents that can be legally used to access critical infrastructure means that the entire process of checking ids is deeply flawed .,Republican
likewise  the time and effort of every law abiding citizen who waits in seemingly endless lines  first to obtain and then to present identification  is wasted .,Republican
document fraud is a crime against all americans who must tolerate the indignity of life in a post-9/11 world .,Republican
why must honest americans prove who we are  again and again  if terrorists and criminals are free to make a hash of this requirement ?,Republican
five weeks ago  the house approved the real id act  just as we did in the 108th congress .,Republican
in so doing  we responded to the challenge put before us by mir aimal kansi  who slaughtered five people at cia headquarters ; by ramzi yousef  who masterminded the first world trade center attack ; and by several of the 9/11 hijackers who would have found it far more difficult  if not impossible  to carry out their terror attacks had we prevented them from using false identification .,Republican
this spending bill also contains funding to secure our borders .,Republican
to secure our nation from nuclear attack  the legislation includes $ 55 million to detect nuclear material at foreign ports .,Republican
the megaports initiative is designed to interdict illicit traffic in nuclear and other radioactive materials .,Republican
by surveilling container shipping at high volume  high risk overseas ports  and by deploying radiation detection devices at our own ports of entry  america 's counter-terrorism strategy can succeed in a comprehensive defense of the global supply chain .,Republican
this bill also provides $ 38.97 million for the terrorist screening center .,Republican
this multi-agency homeland security effort is responsible for supporting the department of homeland security 's effort to screen passengers on both domestic and international flights .,Republican
this new funding will help the tsc to handle new requirements  such as the department of homeland security 's secure flight program .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reject the statement made a minute ago that this is an anti-immigration bill .,Republican
i support the sensenbrenner bill .,Republican
i think security is a national issue .,Republican
but to suggest that this is an anti-immigrant bill is  in my opinion  wrong .,Republican
we support legal immigration into this country .,Republican
it is what has made this country so great .,Republican
but we also need to take care of security .,Republican
if you want to come in on a visa  you want to come in to be a citizen  support it .,Republican
but if you are here illegally  it is wrong .,Republican
each year i have one family  just last year  the father survived .,Republican
the wife died .,Republican
he lost a child to illegal immigrants .,Republican
i wish that was the only case .,Republican
each year we have several of these .,Republican
illegal immigrants driving and causing accidents  and people say  well  they are here ; they have got to go to work .,Republican
well  they will go to work if we can get them to be legal .,Republican
but not if they are here illegally .,Republican
if they are in this country illegally  they need to go out and come back legally with a visa or proper method .,Republican
and that is why i support the sensenbrenner bill  to make sure we do not have metricula cards  we do not have driver 's licenses to illegals  and that the driver 's license has a clip to ensure that it is proper by the federal government .,Republican
mr. chairman  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) talked about  in 1990  when he came to me while i was still in the military asking me about landing mats to put up for the border .,Republican
he and i have actually been down there welding to get that up .,Republican
why ?,Republican
why would we do that ?,Republican
take this floor  if this was a farmer 's field and you had a single strand of wire that was lying on the ground  that is what separated the united states and mexico .,Republican
we had truckloads of drugs coming across in a 100-mile sector that we could not stop .,Republican
in 1 year  there were a number of rapes and a number of murders by the coyotes and people on the u.s. side of people trying to get across .,Republican
when my colleague arranged to put up that fence  it stopped all of it .,Republican
now  there are all kinds of ways in which you can stop something here in this body .,Republican
we can have hearings and say we are going to do this or that  but with the fence area  these 7 miles  another way is to waive the environmental things .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) also showed that president clinton did this .,Republican
if we do not do this  my colleagues  we will not get it done .,Republican
and it will help security .,Republican
documents that we have captured from al qaeda show that they consider the border vulnerable  with cells in mexico itself .,Republican
and so it is not just sealing off the border for security  but it is other things too .,Republican
in san diego  in california  we have about 800  000 illegals in k-through-12 education .,Republican
use half of that  use 400  000 .,Republican
that is $ 2 billion a year out of california .,Republican
that does not account for the $ 1.5 million a day for the school lunch .,Republican
now  i can not stop those kids .,Republican
i have been in those schools .,Republican
there is no way i would take that lunch away from those critters .,Republican
but we need to secure our border to stop the flow coming in .,Republican
if we know  with the bill of the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner )  who is there legally  it is much easier to tell who is there illegally .,Republican
so i ask my colleagues to give this support because we really need to complete this .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise to oppose my friend 's amendment .,Republican
i will tell you why personally .,Republican
i spent a lot of time in saudi .,Republican
they can either go the wrong way or the right way .,Republican
we talk about not putting foreign troops in foreign countries .,Republican
do they have problems ?,Republican
yes .,Republican
but when you talk about the government itself  i know from the intelligence community  i also know how they are helping us there ; but i have been into their banks where they have canadian and u.s. and british auditors to make sure there is no money laundering .,Republican
the government itself  i have met with king aziz  i have met with the crown prince  i have met with almost every one of the shura council  which is their congress .,Republican
the majority of saudis support the united states .,Republican
so to say that their government is against us is wrong .,Republican
are there people that preach wahabism ?,Republican
yes .,Republican
but they have changed their inside curriculum .,Republican
they have arrested and jailed over 1  000 imams which preach intolerance .,Republican
so i would oppose the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
i did not know when we were on the floor that we had an amendment when i went over there .,Republican
it really hurts people when we do things  and i think that this could hurt our relationship instead of bettering it with saudi arabia .,Republican
i oppose the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  i have been flying wing on the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) for about 14 years  and he has always got me home safely .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) and the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
young ) and his wife are out at bethesda in the hospitals every single day taking care of our troops .,Republican
there is no better team than the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
young ) and the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) to make sure that our men and women are safe .,Republican
i have another great friend in the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) .,Republican
and if we were back in the times of troy  i would be achilles  and he would be hector  and we would cross swords  but we would respect each other .,Republican
and there is one area  mr.,Republican
obey  when you mentioned homeland security we can seat those swords .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cox ) is working on the abuses of the homeland security money .,Republican
that is being taken on .,Republican
i think we can work in a very bipartisan way to make sure that that happens .,Republican
i would like to thank the chairman for the border issues  that we have been able to secure our borders with this bill and provide for border patrol .,Republican
many of us have been working on this for years .,Republican
and the speaker has granted us that at the first must-pass bill we can bring this forward .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i rise today in support of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
i want to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his leadership and tireless efforts to secure our nation 's borders .,Republican
last year  the congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act  enacting into law many of the recommendations made by the 9/11 commission .,Republican
unfortunately  not all of the recommendations were included in the first round of legislation  which is why we are here today .,Republican
the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and i committed to working together to make sure that one of the first orders of business considered by the house in the 109th congress would be to address some of the recommendations in our jurisdictions that the congress failed to address last year .,Republican
i want to use my time today to discuss the provisions contained in h.r.,Republican
418 that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform which i chair : security measures for federal acceptance of state-issued driver 's licenses and personal identification cards  commonly referred to as identity security .,Republican
last year 's 9/11 commission report identified a number of gaps and weaknesses in our nation 's intelligence and homeland security systems  providing recommendations for congress to consider in fixing these problems .,Republican
one of the most pressing recommendations proposed by the commission and one that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform appears on page 390 of the 9/11 commission report .,Republican
it is the following : secure identification should begin in the united states .,Republican
the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification  such as driver 's licenses .,Republican
fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft .,Republican
at many entry points to vulnerable facilities  including gates for boarding aircraft  sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists .,Republican
for terrorists  travel documents are as important as weapons .,Republican
the 9/11 hijackers relied on a wide variety of fraudulent documents .,Republican
we know that the 19 hijackers held 63 driver 's licenses or id cards .,Republican
based upon guidelines proposed by state motor vehicle administrators and adopted by a number of states throughout the country  our committee worked with other interested stakeholders to craft legislation that would establish minimum standards to be accepted of state-issued identification that could be used for federal purposes .,Republican
these important provisions were overwhelmingly passed by the house as part of h.r.,Republican
10 and heralded by the 9/11 victims ' families .,Republican
unfortunately  the house-passed provisions critical to strengthening identity security were dropped from the bill in conference .,Republican
instead  language was included that would set up a general framework for a federal role in this area  but the language was filled with so many loopholes and opt-out clauses for states that it really only made matters worse .,Republican
we find ourselves here today to correct these mistakes and to again enact meaningful reform .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 provides the congress with this opportunity .,Republican
our approach is very straightforward .,Republican
our legislation would set forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance of driver 's licenses and state-issued personal identification cards .,Republican
the legislation would provide 3 years for states to come into compliance with these standards if their driver 's licenses are to be recognized for federal government purposes and their documents as proof of an individual 's identity .,Republican
as the 9/11 commission concluded  fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft .,Republican
as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists  those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection .,Republican
we know that the 9/11 hijackers used the united states as their staging area for training and preparation in the year prior to the attacks  traveling into and out of and around the country with little fear of capture .,Republican
in fact  several of the hijackers lived less than 15 miles away from this building while making final preparations for their attack .,Republican
we are dedicated to making sure we do not provide such a hospitable environment in the future .,Republican
as chairman of the committee that oversees federalism issues  i am mindful of concerns about the federal government imposing burdens on states  so-called unfunded mandates .,Republican
my response is threefold .,Republican
one is that this is a national security issue that requires a unified national response rather than 50 separate responses .,Republican
secondly  the legislation authorizes grants to states to conform to the minimum standards set forth in the act .,Republican
third  i am confident that these minimum standards will not be a heavy lift for a majority of the states in our nation .,Republican
it is the handful of states that continue to have lax security standards more than 3 years after 9/11 that may have the most work to do .,Republican
it is crucial that we do everything we can to enhance the security of the american people  and this important legislation takes a significant step in frustrating terrorists ' attempts to integrate into our society .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support h.r.,Republican
418 and strengthen identity security .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from michigan ( mrs.,Republican
miller ) xz4002761  a former secretary of state of the state of michigan  which issues driver 's licenses in michigan  and someone who has been very helpful in crafting this bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today out of frustration with h.r.,Republican
1268  the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act .,Republican
i support passage of this legislation  as i believe it is absolutely necessary to continue to fund the important activities of our brave men and women fighting the global war on terrorism .,Republican
our men and women depend on having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful in mission accomplishment .,Republican
as a member of the house armed services committee  i am actively involved in efforts  for example  to better protect our troops while they are in harm 's way .,Republican
with that said  the inclusion of spending projects within this bill that certainly do not qualify as either `` emergency '' or `` wartime '' is outrageous .,Republican
the issue at hand is not whether or not it is necessary to fund the noble efforts of our soldiers  for that answer is self-evident .,Republican
rather  the question is about our responsibility to spend the american people 's money wisely  and in a manner consistent with the established process .,Republican
i do not doubt that the non-wartime  and non-defense related projects in this bill are worthwhile ; however  the decision to fund these projects should be made during the established appropriations process .,Republican
certainly  it is inappropriate for this body to have to consider legislation under the guise of emergency  wartime spending  when in fact  that description is not completely honest .,Republican
again  i support this funding legislation as it pertains to the support of our military  and our efforts to protect american citizens  and to promote peace and democracy in the middle east .,Republican
however  i do not support the inclusion of unrelated projects within this bill  and find it most unfortunate that members of congress are forced to vote on such legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms.,Republican
foxx ) xz4006430 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would say to my friend  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
farr )  during the last debate i invited him to come down and look at the 7-mile area in that fence  because it is a problem .,Republican
i am looking forward to working with him  because if you are an environmentalist  it is hard pan .,Republican
i mean  it has totally destroyed the plants  the animals  the lizards  and it is like a venturi tube .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) first came to me in 1990 and asked where we could get landing mat  and we put that up .,Republican
why ?,Republican
because the number of rapes of mexicans who were coming across  the number of drugs that were coming across .,Republican
there is one strand of wire on the ground where you could just drive from one field to another with a loaded truck  and it has stopped a lot of that .,Republican
does the fence stop illegal immigration ?,Republican
no .,Republican
but it sure frees up a lot of the border patrol and makes it easier for them  and that 7 miles is like a venturi tube and it forces our border patrol into that area .,Republican
i agree with the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
reyes )  and i am going to work with anybody over there  especially him  because he does have the expertise and he is a good friend .,Republican
i agree with him that the president 's budget does not include the funding .,Republican
but no clinton budget ever passed either  and we are going to add that ; and with the help of my friend  we are going to add the funding for those new border patrol .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i note on page 390 of the 9/11 commission report  it recommends secure identification should begin in the united states .,Republican
the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses .,Republican
mr. chairman  i look forward to working with the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
moran ) on this issue as we move forward .,Republican
mr. chairman  may i inquire of the time on each side .,Republican
mr. chairman  on september 11th  the terrorists did n't just use box cutters and airplanes to attack america  they used our own laws against us to help them murder thousands of people .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act  will fix these loopholes in current law and also take steps to close gaping holes in our land borders  which are the first line of defense against terrorist infiltration  not just for the border states  but also for my home state of wyoming and the rest of the nation .,Republican
we all know how the 9/11 terrorists manipulated our asylum laws to stay in our country  and utilized lax drivers ' license standards to help them carry out their plans .,Republican
we know that human traffickers continue to take advantage of the gaps in our borders  helping terrorist and criminal aliens gain entry into our country .,Republican
yet some still question the need to turn this invaluable knowledge into meaningful action .,Republican
as an original cosponsor of the real id act  i ask my colleagues to look beyond the false rhetoric that has clouded this debate and realize what is really at stake -- the safety and security of our nation .,Republican
i refuse to gamble with the lives of american citizens  rolling the dice on flawed policies that have already failed to protect us against terrorism .,Republican
today we have the opportunity -- and more importantly  the responsibility -- to pass this legislation and make the terrorist handbook obsolete .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
turner ) xz4004110  the former mayor of dayton and chairman of our subcommittee on technology  information policy  intergovernmental relations and the census .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
let me just sum up and say this does not require anything from the states as far as driver 's licenses go .,Republican
states do not have to do anything under this for their driver 's licenses .,Republican
they can issue driver 's licenses to whomever they want .,Republican
but if they intend to use those licenses for federal purposes  we have a right to say what the criteria should be and under those circumstances  they are going to have to show legal presence .,Republican
it is not anti-immigrant .,Republican
in fact  this allows the states to issue two different sets : one for illegal immigrants  one for everyone else .,Republican
it takes the national security issue away from the argument there .,Republican
finally  the opt-out provisions in the current legislation that was passed just a few months ago are disastrous .,Republican
we were worse with the 9/11 response that passed this congress than we were without it .,Republican
this rectifies that .,Republican
it closes that loophole .,Republican
out of respect for the victims  the families  the work of the 9/11 commission  i urge my colleagues to support this legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from san diego  california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in strong support of the conference report on h.r.,Republican
1268 and urge all my colleagues to support it .,Republican
in addition to necessary funding for our troops  tsunami disaster relief  and border security ; this conference report also includes important provisions to bring long-overdue  common sense reform to drivers ' licenses and state-issued identification cards  authored last year by the government reform committee in response to a recommendation of the 9-11 commission .,Republican
mr. speaker  i want to especially thank the speaker and majority leader for making good on their promise to get this legislation to the floor signed into law quickly in the 109th congress .,Republican
i also want to thank my colleague from california  the chairman of the appropriations committee  for his strong support and for agreeing to include these provisions in h.r  1268 .,Republican
finally  i would like to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his tireless work and support on this issue  last year following passage of the 9-11 commission recommendations implementation act  he and i made a commitment to work together to ensure that the most important provisions not addressed in the final bill would be addressed early in the 109th congress .,Republican
that commitment is being fulfilled today .,Republican
judging by the basic nature of these requirements as well as the actions taken by some states  it is quite obvious that not enacting these reforms does not come from a lack of ability  but from a lack of will .,Republican
the federal government can not continue to allow our security responsibilities to be compromised by the inaction of a few .,Republican
our approach is very straightforward .,Republican
building upon guidelines and best practices established and accepted by state motor vehicle administrators  the federal government 's long-standing work on identity security  and actions taken by individual states to shore up their licensing process following the terrorist attacks ; our legislation sets forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance of driver 's licenses and state-issued personal identification cards .,Republican
the legislation provides three years for states to come into compliance with these standards in order for the federal government to recognize their documents as proof of an individual 's identity .,Republican
let me make one thing perfectly clear .,Republican
states that want their drivers ' licenses to be used for federal identification purposes will be required to meet these standards .,Republican
all of them .,Republican
if they do not  the citizens of that state will not be able to use their driver 's license to identify themselves for many purposes that they use them for today  such as boarding an airplane .,Republican
the bill and the report make clear that the secretary must determine the uses  in addition to those set forth in the bill  for which drivers licenses only from complying states will be accepted .,Republican
importantly  the final bill makes clear that the secretary of homeland security will be responsible for ensuring that the certifications represent full compliance .,Republican
this requirement ensures that the national security interests of the united states will be protected through enforcement of the requirements of the bill .,Republican
states will also be required to confirm the applicant 's proof of legal presence in the united states .,Republican
currently  only 11 states lack such a requirement  meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards  but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist .,Republican
importantly  states are still permitted to issue drivers ' licenses to individuals who are not lawfully present in the united states or who can not provide satisfactory proof of identity .,Republican
the ability of states to have such a system is currently under challenge in court  and this legislation will provide them with express authority .,Republican
the bill further provides that these licenses or identification cards must be clearly visually differentiated from other licenses and contain specific language regarding their validity for federal identification and other official purposes .,Republican
in addition  the legislation will require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status -- this will prevent individuals who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the united states from having valid identification documents .,Republican
this loophole was highlighted on september 11th  as nawaf al hazmi and hani hanjour  the pilots of flight 77  both obtained licenses and identification cards after the expiration of their visa authorization .,Republican
we must correct this dangerous problem before we again give individuals who have overstayed their visas the tools they need to integrate into society and carry out criminal and terrorist acts .,Republican
mr. speaker  it is important to note that these actions are consistent with actions taken by individual states to date .,Republican
for example  nevada and new mexico do not accept  as proof of identity  a state-issued driver license or identification card from states that do not meet their own standards .,Republican
the federal government has been delinquent in dealing with this issue  but we are correcting that problem today .,Republican
fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft .,Republican
as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists  those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection .,Republican
we must be able to establish  as close to certainty as we can  that people are who they say they are  and in order to do so the federal government must have documents that it can trust .,Republican
in fact  we would not be fulfilling our security role for the american people if we did not .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to support these important provisions and the passage of this conference report .,Republican
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the distinguished whip  the gentleman from maryland  for yielding to me .,Republican
mr. speaker  the house will convene on tuesday at 2 p.m .,Republican
for legislative business .,Republican
we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules .,Republican
a final list of those bills will be sent to members ' offices by the end of the week .,Republican
any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6 : 30 p.m .,Republican
on wednesday and thursday  the house will convene at 10 a.m .,Republican
we likely will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules  as well as h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
finally  i would like to remind members that we do not plan  do not plan  to have votes next friday  february 11 .,Republican
and i thank the gentleman for yielding to me  and i would be happy to answer any questions he may have .,Republican
we are contemplating several major pieces of legislation that we would hope to complete before the easter break  and we are also contemplating several bills that we contemplate completing prior to the presidents ' day district work period .,Republican
the comprehensive energy bill  which we passed in the last congress and in the 107th congress  is a very high priority for this year .,Republican
there is a good chance that we could consider a national energy policy bill before the presidents ' day district work period .,Republican
that is correct .,Republican
mr. speaker  if the gentleman will continue to yield  i would assume that the committee on rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest of the 9/11 commission 's recommendations  and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety of amendments .,Republican
but i will let the chairman of the committee on rules make announcements on that and reserve decisions for the committee on what those amendments will be .,Republican
i can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating  although actions by the committee on rules will need to be taken  contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill  another must-pass piece of legislation  not knowing what that would be .,Republican
but  obviously  the supplement could be a candidate for that .,Republican
mr. speaker  issues like this one -- first brought to our attention with a passion and eloquence only possible in a man like jerry solomon -- provide our democracy a valuable service : they cut through the fog of spin and force us to tell the american people exactly where we stand .,Republican
pure and simple  this bills says our armed services -- the army  navy  air force  marines  coast guard  and national guard -- should have the same right to recruit at colleges and universities who receive federal funding as any other group .,Republican
every year  thousands upon thousands of businesses  industries  non-profit groups  and even other colleges recruit underclassmen to sign up to become investment bankers and computer engineers or environmental lawyers or medical students .,Republican
and yet  some colleges -- principally the elitist and elite colleges -- refuse to even allow military recruiters on their campuses .,Republican
such policies are obnoxious in times of peace  but they are simply intolerable in times of war  and the equal access of our military recruiters to federally funded colleges and universities must be protected .,Republican
but that  mr.,Republican
speaker  is the easy part .,Republican
the hard part is understanding why facilities and administrations of these colleges do n't want military recruiters on their campuses .,Republican
because  at bottom  their opposition to the presence of veterans at their schools is not about academic freedom  or civil liberties .,Republican
it 's about them not liking the military  or the values our men and women in uniform represent .,Republican
it 's about many of them preferring the company of people who blame the united states for 9/11 -- who compare the world trade center victims to nazis -- to the company of a soldier or a sailor or an airman or a marine .,Republican
it 's about academia feeling more sympathy for terrorists than for the women and children they murder .,Republican
it 's about a fundamental misconception about the purpose of a university -- the professors are there for the students  mr.,Republican
speaker  and not the other way around .,Republican
that our military makes our academia possible  and not the other way around .,Republican
indeed  the right of tenured academics to be publicly insufferable exists only because of the sacrifices of our servicemen and women .,Republican
the least they could offer in return is a booth in the field house on career day .,Republican
of course  men and women who have dodged bullets and held dying comrades in their arms do n't take seriously people who live by the glib professional code `` publish or perish.,Republican
'' but those elite campuses  who claim to educate our nation 's best and brightest  who claim to train our leaders of the future : how can we possibly not allow military recruiters to have the right to talk to such students ?,Republican
what profession  if any in our entire society  needs the opportunity to recruit the sharpest and broadest minds of every generation more than our armed forces ?,Republican
america 's armed services have molded great men from all walks of life  and when given brilliant men and women  they have produced legends .,Republican
how can we let such minds pass through our top colleges without even the chance that they might bump into a veteran recruiter who could change their life ?,Republican
america in the future no doubt will need its brilliant businessmen and lawyers and poets  but what good can such genius do without brilliant admirals and generals to protect them ?,Republican
mr. speaker  it 's a shame this issue was ever forced on us at all  but the vote on this bill will help to clarify exactly what we each mean when we say we support the troops .,Republican
we 'll finally see who among us really believes the military deserves more than just lip service from those of us they protect .,Republican
votes like this  after all  remind us of one of the great blessings of american democracy : that unlike college professors  congressmen do n't have tenure .,Republican
well  mr.,Republican
speaker  if the gentleman will continue to yield  i would just say that the gentleman is right .,Republican
we will try our best to reach out and make this bill as bipartisan as possible .,Republican
i would just remind the gentleman that this bill  this energy package  has passed  i can not recall every time  but many times in the last congress ; and it even passed this house as a conference report .,Republican
each time that the energy bill has gone through this house  whether it be the house bill or in the conference report  it has enjoyed a very large democrat vote .,Republican
so  yes  i would hope that the chairmen of the respective committees that have a piece of this bill  and i would also remind the gentleman that the committee on ways and means has a very big piece of this bill  would reach out to their ranking members and work to put together as bipartisan a bill as possible .,Republican
i appreciate the gentleman yielding to me  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
we have not discussed any rule .,Republican
actually  we are discussing with the relevant committee chairmen whether we can get it that quickly or not .,Republican
but i would imagine that the committee on rules would have the same sort of rule that we have had on this bill for the last couple of years .,Republican
so i would not see anything changing .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would just say to my good friend from texas ( mr.,Republican
reyes )  who is an expert  and we all value his input  we are going to do immigration reform in this congress .,Republican
we are looking forward to working with him on immigration reform .,Republican
but what we are here today about is border security  border security and closing loopholes .,Republican
i just want to thank both sides of the aisle for the thoughtful way that they have conducted this debate .,Republican
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) and the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) for their hard work in getting this bill to the floor so early in the new session .,Republican
of all of the issues being debated before us today  the controversy i find most confusing is the section regarding the standardization of driver 's licenses .,Republican
after all  mr.,Republican
chairman  the war on terror is not being fought in a vacuum .,Republican
there was a time  to be sure  when identification fraud was a matter of concern principally to bouncers and bartenders  but that was before september 11  2001 .,Republican
since that day  mr.,Republican
chairman  id fraud has represented a clear and present danger to the national security of the united states  plain and simple .,Republican
without standards for the issuance or content of driver 's licenses  the american people are needlessly put at risk .,Republican
as long as america boasts the civilized world 's most open laws concerning immigration and mobility while remaining its greatest terrorist target  we must ensure that people coming in and out of our country are not here to do our people harm .,Republican
when someone enters this country and can get a driver 's license  he can board a plane  open a bank account  and get a job .,Republican
if he plans to do these things not to make a better life for himself  but with the express intent of killing americans  and that treachery could be curbed simply by reforming the way we issue driver 's licenses  how can we not ?,Republican
the real id act requires that applicants for driver 's licenses prove that they are in the united states legally  very simple  and that a foreign traveler 's license expires with his visa .,Republican
these are hardly draconian measures  mr.,Republican
chairman  nor are the sections of the bill that strengthen our deportation and asylum processes .,Republican
these processes are not just loopholes ; they are gaping  yawning chasms in the law waiting to be exploited .,Republican
they are risks  threats even  to the security of our homeland and to our success in the war on terror .,Republican
the reforms in the real id act are overdue  no less an authority than the 9/11 commission itself says so .,Republican
so i just urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation to further help ensure that such events as three septembers ago never again scar our homeland .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in strong support of h. con .,Republican
res.,Republican
36 .,Republican
this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the so-called solomon law  a critical piece of legislation originally passed in 1994 which has helped ensure that military recruiters have equal access on our nation 's campuses .,Republican
we are debating this resolution today only because of a recent court decision that wrongfully struck down the solomon law .,Republican
in november of last year  a closely divided u.s. third circuit court of appeals ruled that the solomon law violates first amendment rights to free speech and association .,Republican
the court sided with the plaintiff arguing that `` the solomon amendment requires law schools to express a message that is incompatible with their educational objectives  and no compelling governmental interest has been shown to deny this freedom.,Republican
'' mr.,Republican
speaker  i can not disagree more with this assessment .,Republican
in our post-9/11 world  our nation 's military deserves  at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy .,Republican
this is certainly a modest and i believe a reasonable request  especially if the college or university accepts federal funds .,Republican
this is not about infringing free speech ; it is about ensuring our military has access to our nation 's best and brightest at a time when we face enormous challenges abroad .,Republican
this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the solomon law and would help ensure that military recruiters continue to have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope as that provided to any other employer .,Republican
this resolution would reaffirm the commitment of congress to explore all options  including the use of its constitutional power to appropriate funds to achieve that equal access .,Republican
in adopting this resolution  we would also be urging the executive branch to aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the solomon law .,Republican
also  we would be encouraging the executive branch to follow a doctrine of nonacquiescence by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on any other jurisdiction .,Republican
mr. speaker  as we debate this resolution  it is important for us to remember that the solomon law and its legislative updates were not designed as one-size-fits-all mandates from washington .,Republican
in fact  the law is very flexible  and it fits the needs of nearly every public-funded institution in the country .,Republican
for example  the solomon law does not apply to colleges or universities that have a long-standing policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds  nor does it affect any federal student aid or financial assistance .,Republican
of course  as those of us who are here debating this issue are aware  this is not the first challenge to this law .,Republican
prior to the november circuit court decision  on repeated occasions lower courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law  arguing that it does not infringe on any institution 's right to free speech or association .,Republican
while this recent court decision is unfortunate  it is not the end to the solomon law .,Republican
a bipartisan vote here today in support of this legislation will help send a clear message to our courts that our military recruiters deserve equal access on all of our campuses .,Republican
i thank the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910 for his ongoing efforts on this issue  and i thank the gentleman from minnesota ( mr.,Republican
kline ) xz4002240 for managing this legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of this rule .,Republican
contrary to what my very good friend from fort lauderdale has said  this is a very fair and balanced rule .,Republican
if we look at the amendments that were submitted to the committee on rules and those that we have made in order  it is fascinating .,Republican
we made half of the amendments in order that were proposed by the democrats  those were the priorities established  and 33 percent of the amendments made in order that were submitted by the republicans .,Republican
we have really turned ourselves inside out to try and accommodate the wide array of issues that were put forward before the committee on rules .,Republican
yesterday  we had three committees of jurisdiction share an hour and 40 minutes of general debate  and we are going to have an opportunity for free-flowing debate on a wide range of issues today .,Republican
and i am anxiously looking forward to that .,Republican
i would like to say that one of the priorities is the passage of the sessions amendment  which is very  very fair and  i believe  an appropriate way to deal with one of the important challenges we face .,Republican
mr. speaker  let me say  there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not we were going to make the nadler amendment in order  as my friend knows .,Republican
i know that that addresses the issue of asylum .,Republican
we are going to have an opportunity for debate on that and an up-or-down vote on that issue .,Republican
we clearly had to deal with a wide range of questions as we fashioned this rule .,Republican
i will tell the gentleman that i am very proud of the fact that we were able to incorporate many of the ideas that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offered .,Republican
i will tell the gentleman there were 10 amendments submitted by members of the minority  and six of those 10 amendments were  in fact  withdrawn .,Republican
we made in order two of the four amendments that remained at the committee level .,Republican
we had on our side 10 amendments that were submitted  and we have only made three of our amendments in order of the original 10 that were submitted .,Republican
that is why i am arguing that we have  in fact  really gone the extra mile to ensure that the rights of the minority are respected .,Republican
i appreciate the gentleman yielding .,Republican
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time  i would say to my friend that clearly we are debating this right now  during consideration of the rule .,Republican
we have had special orders held on this issue .,Republican
we had a very lengthy hearing in the committee on rules which was available for all of the members ; we had that streamed online .,Republican
so i think that these issues are pretty darned transparent .,Republican
we are trying to deal with border security .,Republican
it is a very important part of the number one priority that we have  and that is our national security .,Republican
i think in light of that  we are going to have an opportunity to consider these measures  and i want to say that i think we have some amendments that are very  very important that do need to be addressed .,Republican
we did make in order the amendment by the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
farr ) xz4001290  my colleague  which calls for steps that would prevent the completion of the 3.5 mile gap in the 14-mile fence that goes along the border from the pacific ocean to the otai mesa in san diego .,Republican
i have to say that it is amazing  mr.,Republican
speaker  to observe that it took a shorter period of time to win the second world war than it has to complete this fence .,Republican
it is a fence wherein actually the provision for it was signed into law by president clinton back in 1997  and that was done with strong bipartisan support .,Republican
i worked with my colleagues  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910  and our colleague mr.,Republican
ose in the last congress  who was very involved in this ; and i just 10 weeks ago flew with t.j. bonner  the president of the national border patrol council  over this gap in the fence .,Republican
it is very clear that people have taken advantage of it .,Republican
now  the argument that is going to be used on the fence issue  and we will be bringing that up in just a little while  has to do with the environment .,Republican
there are people who say that we need to keep all of these environmental constraints in place which have prevented completion of the fence .,Republican
mr. speaker  what has happened is  we have seen the california coastal commission file a case to prevent completion of it because of something known as the bell 's verio bird .,Republican
this bird has chosen to nest on part of the fence  and for that reason  they can not complete the fence  and it has allowed people to come in .,Republican
now  what has happened is  people have illegally fled across the border .,Republican
we have seen that border in what is known as the tijuana estuary devastated environmentally .,Republican
there is all kinds of trash in there  and the environmental vote  mr.,Republican
speaker  is to vote against the farr amendment in favor of completion of the fence .,Republican
if we were to complete the fence  we would be able to improve the environmental standard at the border .,Republican
now  this issue is one of the important parts of it  but there is one other issue that i want to mention before i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
i introduced legislation  h.r.,Republican
100  to deal with something known as the saint cyr decision  that is included in the manager 's amendment ; and what that does  basically  the provision that we have in the manager 's amendment will finally get to the point where the appellate courts are the courts of jurisdiction  and we will not see consistent appeals .,Republican
not many people are aware of the fact that  actually  people who are here illegally have an additional appellate step over american citizens .,Republican
in the manager 's amendment  we will be able to rectify that very  very important issue that does need to be addressed .,Republican
this is a fair and balanced rule .,Republican
it will allow us to deal with border security  a very important part of our national security ; and i hope this great day will see us  at the end  pass this very important legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank my friend for yielding me this time  and let me just say what it is that got us here .,Republican
i have listened to the arguments propounded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle .,Republican
we are here because  as the chairman of the judiciary said  it has taken longer to complete this fence than it did to win the second world war .,Republican
the problem that we have is  there needs to be recognition that the environmentally sound vote is to complete this fence .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910 held up a poster .,Republican
if you look at where the fence has been completed  it is pristine  it is clean  it looks great  and it is securing our borders .,Republican
if you look at that 3 1/2 -mile gap  you see all kinds of trash and devastation and you  of course  exacerbate the pressure with the flow of people coming into this country illegally  creating a wide range of problems .,Republican
we came this close  when we had strong support  257 members of this body in the last congress who voted for the ose amendment that should have been included in the 9/11 committee 's recommendation in the conference agreement that we had .,Republican
the other body prevented us when we were working in the conference to bring it back here .,Republican
we had indications from democrats and republicans alike that if we brought this measure up we could have strong support of it .,Republican
it is imperative  it is imperative that we complete this fence .,Republican
smugglers gulch is an area which is  i believe  posing a very serious threat to our stability in this country and in california .,Republican
so i urge my colleagues to oppose the farr amendment and cast the environmentally sound vote  which is a `` no '' vote .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from massachusetts .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank my colleague for yielding me this time .,Republican
and i appreciate his bringing this amendment to the floor  and i support it .,Republican
it is absolutely critical that we secure our borders .,Republican
those of us who live in arizona know that our borders are simply not secure .,Republican
arizona has become a doormat for illegal aliens .,Republican
there are thousands and thousands that are apprehended every week and thousands more who are not apprehended .,Republican
they slip through .,Republican
the cost to arizona is considerable .,Republican
now  i happen to believe  along with my colleague  that we need comprehensive immigration reform that has to be part of our long-term plan .,Republican
but in the interim  we certainly need to do some things  and this amendment goes a long way toward doing them .,Republican
we need vulnerability and threat assessments .,Republican
dhs needs to see what kind of technology  what kind of personnel and equipment is going to be needed .,Republican
all of us have viewed over the past couple of years the new technologies in land surveillance  surface surveillance  and they are promising .,Republican
they are things that can be done that are not being done .,Republican
we need a good assessment and recommendations made for us to follow through on .,Republican
we have aerial work that is being done ; not enough  more surveillance is needed there .,Republican
also  this amendment calls for increased communications  better communications between those on the ground and those of us here as policymakers and those who implement the policy .,Republican
we simply need better information to be able to have recommendations that we can follow up on .,Republican
we have  obviously  limited resources at our disposal .,Republican
we need to make sure that they are employed in the best way possible  and this amendment will go a long way toward ensuring that .,Republican
again  i commend the gentleman from arizona for bringing this forward  and the chairman for insisting that this bill be brought forward .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of this rule  which will simply allow us to consider general debate  and in 7 minutes we are going to be up in the committee on rules considering a number of those issues that the gentleman from florida just raised  deciding what it is that we will debate here on the house floor tomorrow .,Republican
so the process is still ongoing and members are involved in that  and it is one that we look forward to considering before too long .,Republican
i want to congratulate the gentleman from dallas  texas ( mr.,Republican
sessions ) for his very strong commitment to all homeland security issues  a top priority .,Republican
and i will say  mr.,Republican
speaker  that border security is a critically important aspect of the number one priority that we have at the federal level .,Republican
the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of the u.s. constitution are `` provide for the common defense  '' and securing our borders is a priority  and it should be of any sovereign nation .,Republican
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) and i had the privilege of serving as conferees last fall as we sought to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Republican
unfortunately  our friends in the other body decided not to include provisions that would provide guidelines to ensure that the likes of mohammed atta who flew a plane into the world trade center just days before he was to appear in court because of a traffic violation that he had had with a driver 's license  that was something that we felt strongly should have been incorporated to rectify that in the 9/11 commission recommendations .,Republican
unfortunately  our colleagues in the other body chose to ignore that .,Republican
the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
ose ) worked hard to ensure that we would be able to complete the 3 1/2 -mile gap through what is known as smugglers gulch  an area that is today devastated environmentally because people cross the border illegally .,Republican
unfortunately  our colleagues in the other body refused to accept that .,Republican
both of those things were issues that were of concern to the 9/11 commission ; and if we look at the 9/11 commission report  they make it very clear that we need to address these kinds of issues as they relate to border security .,Republican
so what we decided  of course  at the end  as we prepare to implement that  was that we would  as soon as the 109th congress convened  proceed with passage of this very important aspect of our border security and  by virtue of that  our national security .,Republican
that is why i think this measure should enjoy strong bipartisan support .,Republican
this is an issue that democrats and republicans alike can come together on to ensure that we do  we do  secure our borders .,Republican
so i think that we have a wonderful opportunity here to deal with border security .,Republican
the issue of immigration reform is another question .,Republican
i am supporting this effort on border security in part because i am convinced that we will be able to  down the road and i hope soon  address the immigration reform question .,Republican
i happen to believe that it is important for us to identify the people who are here in this country illegally .,Republican
and  yes  i am opposed to granting blanket amnesty  as is president bush  but i do believe that moving in the direction of some sort of worker program is something that we must look at and must address .,Republican
but we are taking a proper step in finally doing what we wanted to have incorporated in the 9/11 commission package that we passed out of here  and i congratulate all my colleagues who have been involved in this .,Republican
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of h.r.,Republican
1268 making supplemental appropriations to ensure that our forces who are hard at work in iraq and afghanistan  and elsewhere  have the tools they need to do their job  and are well protected .,Republican
mr. speaker  this week we witnessed the establishment of iraq 's first democratically elected government in over half a century and their swearing in .,Republican
this event is yet another historic milestone in iraq 's progress toward a representative and transparent government .,Republican
but even as we see important movement toward democracy  we are reminded that `` freedom is not free.,Republican
'' as those of us who have seen war know  it is paid first by the sacrifices of those who serve .,Republican
their courage is our inspiration .,Republican
we wish them godspeed  swift victory and safe return .,Republican
however  while it pales in comparison to the sacrifices of our brave men and women in the field  there is another part of the equation .,Republican
and it is before us today .,Republican
with this legislation  congress is acting decisively to ensure that our soldiers  sailors and airmen have the resources they need to keep iraq on the road back to the community of civilized nations .,Republican
this bill contains over $ 76 billion to support military activities .,Republican
this sum will : pay for the troop deployment ; repair and replace damaged vehicles being chewed up in an extreme harshly operating environment ; replenish stores of munitions and supplies ; and provide additional armor for vehicles  improved communications gear and more night-vision equipment .,Republican
i would also add that this bill also provides over $ 60 million for additional electronic devices designed to protect our forces from the `` weapon of choice '' of the insurgents -- ieds .,Republican
mr. speaker  this `` wartime supplemental '' appropriations bill meets our military  humanitarian and foreign policy requirements .,Republican
we have every reason to be proud of young men and women at war .,Republican
every single word of praise uttered on this floor today is justified .,Republican
but while our young men and women in uniform appreciate our vocal support  they need this bill .,Republican
it will provide them with the tools they need to get their job done as quickly as possible so they can return home to their families .,Republican
i commend mr.,Republican
lewis  the chairman of the appropriations committee -- the gentleman from california -- for his leadership .,Republican
and i urge passage of the legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i offer an amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  if the gentleman will yield  did i actually say that ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i am sorry  i should have stepped in before the gentleman stood up to say  in light of knowing the rules of the house  that i was about to withdraw the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  the question before us today  i believe  is how now shall we live within the confines of the budget that we have to deal with ?,Republican
shall we live within the boundaries that we have set for ourselves and set an example for our generation today and the future  or should we ignore those boundaries that we have imposed upon ourselves and spend in excess ?,Republican
right now we are in the process  as we know  of doing the budget for next year  the 2006 budget .,Republican
we are setting up the framework of what we will be spending for next year .,Republican
and so i think it is fitting and appropriate that we look at the supplemental today and the amendment that i have presented to see whether or not we will fit within that budget confines  whether or not we will fit within that area or  instead  will we exceed it and say that a budget really is nothing more than a charade and not explain exactly what we will be spending for any point in time .,Republican
let me just say that i applaud the chairman  and i applaud the members of the committee for doing what they said they would do as has been reported in the paper .,Republican
to use the chairman 's own words  they have taken the president 's proposal and scrubbed it thoroughly for many points that they thought appropriate to remove from that spending proposal .,Republican
my question  though  is  can we do a little bit better ?,Republican
can we go a little bit further ?,Republican
can we do exactly what we ask families to do back at home ?,Republican
think for a moment .,Republican
what would a family do today if they faced emergency expenditures like we are looking at in the supplemental right now  families who maybe have to see extra car payments or medical expenses ?,Republican
what would a family do ?,Republican
a family would probably have to do what we should be doing right here  and that is limit our spending elsewhere  reduce some other unnecessary spending so that we have that money for the emergency spending .,Republican
if we look in the supplemental  there are a number of points in there that have already been raised by others .,Republican
i will just point to one of them  the aid for tsunami victims .,Republican
that started at $ 35 million  went up to $ 150 million  then $ 350 million  and now we are looking at $ 950 million .,Republican
some would question whether we can even spend all that before the end of this fiscal year .,Republican
as a matter of fact  i spoke with people from the world bank and they said that they are not even sure where the money would all be going to .,Republican
they do not have an exact figure as to what we should be spending on long-term needs  so we can question whether or not we should be spending that money .,Republican
but given that we can argue that back and forth  let us take that as a given that we should spend the entire $ 950 million for tsunami relief .,Republican
i would ask this  as we stand here before the world as a body saying that we are going to do the charitable thing and give money to the tsunami victims  are we really exercising any charity there when we  in fact  say  we 're not going to be paying for it  we 're asking our kids and our grandkids to pay for it in excessive spending and deficit spending in future generations ?,Republican
again  i applaud the chairman for the good start that they have done in this committee by scrubbing the budget and trying to find some offsets .,Republican
i would simply say  can we not do a little bit better and find completely all offsets for all of the spending that we are doing  aside from the military defense spending  for all the excessive spending in the bill ?,Republican
it is around $ 4 billion .,Republican
how much would it really come out to be ?,Republican
if you are looking at the budget that we have right now that we are living under  $ 2.5 trillion  and you are trying to find savings or offsets of around $ 4 billion  that is only two- tenths of 1 percent .,Republican
i would ask  can we not find two-tenths of 1 percent of waste  fraud and abuse in the entire fiscal budget that we are operating under right now ?,Republican
i think we can .,Republican
we ask families to do it for their budgets  we ask businesses to do it for their budgets  i think we can find that entire amount of approximately $ 4 billion of waste  fraud  and abuse in the entire budget  offset it  and then we can truly stand before the world and say that when we are making charitable contributions to the tsunami relief victims  that it is truly coming from this generation and not being passed on to future generations .,Republican
i shall end where i began .,Republican
how now shall we live ?,Republican
we shall live within the means  by the parameters that we have set down upon ourselves .,Republican
we shall live within the budget that we have set for ourselves and not outside that budget .,Republican
that is correct .,Republican
mr. speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank my colleague on the committee on rules .,Republican
i rise in full support of the rule and the underlying bill .,Republican
i remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who keep saying  we are not given enough time and we are rushing all of these complicated issues that we have not discussed  but these provisions i remind my colleagues  they were in the original bill that we passed on the house side  the intel bill .,Republican
unfortunately  they were taken out by the senate conferees .,Republican
we are asking to do the things that the 9/11 commission  all 10 of them  in their unanimous report  asked us to do .,Republican
listen to this : `` if terrorist travel options are reduced  they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable.,Republican
'' the 9/11 commission report  page 65  `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of united states identification document  some by fraud.,Republican
'' acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights  renting cars  and other necessary activities .,Republican
the 9/11 commission report  page 390  `` my daughter worked at the republican convention this summer .,Republican
i worried about her .,Republican
unbeknownst to me  during the convention an illegal alien from pakistan was picked up and arrested for attempting to bomb the herald square subway station .,Republican
she rode on that subway every day going back and forth to work.,Republican
'' he was quoted as saying  `` i want at least 1  000 to 2  000 to die in a single day.,Republican
'' and that alien had applied for asylum .,Republican
mr. speaker  these are sensible provisions .,Republican
we are completing the work of the intel bill  and i support it .,Republican
we need to get it done and we need bipartisan support .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am not on the committee on the judiciary .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
i supported the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act last december .,Republican
that legislation helped to streamline the intelligence community and tightened some asylum rules that allowed potential terrorists to remain in our country .,Republican
that was a good bill  but it did not go far enough .,Republican
so i am pleased that the house is debating h.r.,Republican
418 -- a bill that i believe will continue to strengthen our borders  further improve identification standards  and close even more asylum loopholes .,Republican
we know that mohamed atta and his gang of terrorists exploited weak identification rules  and  as stated in the 9/11 commission report  `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of identification document  some by fraud.,Republican
'' h.r.,Republican
418 will require that federal agencies only accept licenses and state-issued id cards when states have determined that the holder is lawfully present in the country .,Republican
the bill will also require that temporary visitors to our country receive only temporary identification  and that this identification expire when the terms of the visit expire .,Republican
mr. chairman  this only makes sense .,Republican
i am also pleased that this bill further reforms our asylum system  a system that has unfortunately been ripe for corruption for years .,Republican
we are also addressing the san diego border fence issue and will ensure the expeditious completion of the border fence .,Republican
further  the bill makes aliens deportable for terrorism-related offenses .,Republican
incredibly  current law provided that not all terrorism-related grounds for keeping an alien out of the country are also grounds for deportion .,Republican
this bill closes that loophole .,Republican
the simple fact is that we need to secure our borders .,Republican
today 's bill is another step toward this effort and i believe it will make our country safer .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the real id act .,Republican
mr. chairman  reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman .,Republican
i appreciate his response  and i am very pleased to know that faith-based groups will have the same opportunity to compete for these important dollars with other nongovernmental entities so that together this funding can be used to alleviate the suffering of the tsunami victims .,Republican
i thank the gentleman .,Republican
mr. chairman  i come to the floor today to speak in support of the real id act .,Republican
it is clear that in order to secure our country from terrorists we need to reform the requirements and standards for driver 's licenses .,Republican
a valid driver 's license is like a hall pass that allows terrorists to easily roam throughout the united states .,Republican
indeed 19 terrorists did just that with dozens of legal driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Republican
the hijackers used these ids to rent cars and apartments  open bank accounts  take flying lessons  and otherwise blend into american society while they planned their attacks .,Republican
those terrorists murdered 3  000 americans and yet this gap still remains open .,Republican
in every state  the driver 's license ( and its counterpart  the state id card ) is the primary document used to establish identity and proof of legal residence .,Republican
making driver 's licenses accessible to illegal aliens gives them the means to pass themselves off as legal residents of the united states .,Republican
additionally  the real id act does not create a national id card .,Republican
in addition to establishing standards for the issuance of licenses  h.r.,Republican
418 includes provisions to prevent terrorists from gaming our asylum system .,Republican
court decisions in recent years have so distorted the asylum process that terrorists are now able to claim asylum specifically because they are terrorists .,Republican
this legislation represents a critical first step toward gaining control over our borders and protecting american lives .,Republican
these are common-sense measures that should be implemented immediately .,Republican
terrorism may have no borders  but we can certainly make it more difficult for terrorists to cross ours .,Republican
having a uniform policy that relies on common sense will do more to keep america open and free than having a policy that relies on hope .,Republican
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word and enter into a brief colloquy with the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
kolbe ) xz4002260 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i believe it is important that all groups and organizations that want to assist in the recovery are allowed to participate .,Republican
the united states agency for international development issued a regulation on october 19  2004  that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete on an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding  in the case of this bill  funding to help tsunami victims .,Republican
can the chairman clarify whether the appropriations under this bill fall under such regulation ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentlewoman for her good questions and for yielding .,Republican
we are not sure at this point whether they include that information or not at tsa  because simply they have databases and we do not know necessarily what is in their databases  and i do not blame them at all .,Republican
they are not prone to reveal all of that .,Republican
it is our judgment they should be doing this .,Republican
we hope that they would be doing it .,Republican
we do not know if they are for sure or not .,Republican
i can not confirm or deny that  because we simply do not know the answer to that particular question .,Republican
i would imagine  and i am putting myself in their position and i am not an expert on this  but if you are there and are in the security forces there  you are obviously trained in document recognition to some great degree .,Republican
some are better probably than others at this .,Republican
obviously  if one has a database  it is obviously much more of a clear signal that this person needs to be looked at because they tried to do this before .,Republican
that is the reason we feel it should be added into the database as it goes on .,Republican
i do not think this is going to change actually the way they look at licenses presently in the first instance or even in second instance .,Republican
it is just a trigger mark as other things might be in terms of potential risks .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman for this time .,Republican
i rise in strong support of this conference report as the people 's house at long last takes care of some unfinished business .,Republican
in the closing days of the 108th congress  some in the other body objected to commonsense provisions that deal with our national security and our border security  to wit  the notion that when you apply for a driver 's license or another legal document  you should be who you say you are  and you should enjoy legal status in this country .,Republican
this supplemental conference report includes the real id act  and at long last the congress of the united states gets real and understands that border security and national security are one and the same .,Republican
pass this to help protect our borders and help protect our national security .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank my friend from texas for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in favor of the rule  and i rise in favor of the sessions amendment .,Republican
the amendment makes certain that before an alien is released from dhs detention on his own recognizance pending an upcoming hearing  the immigration judge first certify that the alien is not a flight risk and  more importantly  that he does not pose a security risk to the united states .,Republican
mr. speaker  i appreciate the different views that we hear in the well of this house .,Republican
i understand full well dr .,Republican
franklin 's admonition about the challenge confronting those who seek security and yet also wish to preserve liberty .,Republican
mr. speaker  one of the reasons we are here on the floor visiting this issue today is  as the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules pointed out  while our founders believed that all men were created equal  now we have the arcanities and absurdities of certain judicial procedures that allow illegal aliens to enjoy more legal privacy in some cases than do american citizens .,Republican
we need redress .,Republican
i listened with great interest to my friends who came to the floor recently discovering states rights with reference to this legislation  and i believe that to be a hopeful sign .,Republican
i listened with great interest to other friends who came to offer scriptural and spiritual entreaties in this debate  and i welcome that as well .,Republican
but  mr.,Republican
speaker  here is the fundamental question we confront .,Republican
in the wake of 9/11  in the wake of clear and demonstrable evidence that there are those who come to this nation with the intent of harming and killing americans  who are bent on the destruction of our nation and our system of government  at long last this body should take the steps necessary to preserve our security and our liberty .,Republican
border security is national security .,Republican
there has been lament expressed from the other side that we are moving too quickly .,Republican
indeed  mr.,Republican
speaker  i came to this well in a previous congress lamenting the fact that at the behest of the other body we remove these important provisions from a piece of legislation passed at the end of the last session of congress .,Republican
incrementalism in wartime is unacceptable .,Republican
there is a clear and present danger .,Republican
we must respond .,Republican
pass the rule .,Republican
pass the sessions amendment .,Republican
pass the underlying legislation .,Republican
let us preserve and protect our union and our way of life .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of the real id act  and i thank the chairman for his courage and hard work on this vital measure .,Republican
over a decade ago  the ability of ramzi yousef  the mastermind behind the 1993 world trade center bombing to be granted asylum and to move freely in the country should have signaled that something was terribly wrong with our system .,Republican
it did not  and 8 years later  19 terrorists collectively carrying a total of 63 valid u.s. driver 's licenses  boarded planes to finish yousef 's work .,Republican
it is now over 3 years since that tragic september 11th .,Republican
today  we are considering a vital piece of legislation to address three key failures of current security policy .,Republican
first  the real id act mandates standards to obtain driver 's licenses ; second  it tightens our nation 's asylum laws  which easily allow suspected terrorists into our nation ; and finally  it addresses the need to secure our borders .,Republican
these concepts are not rocket science .,Republican
the need for these reforms has been reiterated over and over  and in expert testimony  in anecdotal evidence from security professionals  in scholarly research and in evidence presented from our nation 's justice and military personnel .,Republican
but the fact of the matter is  the most compelling reason to pass this bill is just plain old common sense .,Republican
we can not repeat enough what the 9/11 commission said : `` for terrorists  travel documents are as important as weapons.,Republican
'' they are right .,Republican
they also said  `` it is elemental to border security to know who is coming into the country.,Republican
'' today  more than 9 million people have entered the united states outside the legal immigration system .,Republican
the security chain protecting america is only as good as its weakest link .,Republican
it does not take a congressman or a national security expert to tell you this .,Republican
most americans know that despite the rhetoric we hear against this bill  as long as we ignore the need for border security  we place them and their families at risk .,Republican
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the real id act .,Republican
mr. speaker  the real id act completes the mission of the 9/11 commission recommendations by implementing common sense reforms to strengthen our borders security and better protect our homeland .,Republican
driver 's licenses have become the primary identification document in the united states  enabling individuals to get other identity documents  transfer funds to a u.s. bank account  obtain access to federal buildings and other vulnerable facilities  purchase a firearm  rent a car and board a plane .,Republican
lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver 's licenses -- often multiple licenses from different states -- and abuse the license for identification purposes .,Republican
the sept 11th hijackers had  within their possession  at least 15 valid drivers licenses and numerous state issued identity cards with a large variety of addresses .,Republican
identification documents are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists .,Republican
the real id act would require applicants to provide proof they are in the country legally .,Republican
currently  eleven states do not have such a requirement  meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards  but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist .,Republican
the real id act would require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status  preventing those who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the u.s. from having valid identification documents .,Republican
states would still issue driver 's licenses and identification cards and would control their own driver database .,Republican
the 9-11 commission 's staff report on `` 9-11 and terrorist travel '' found that `` a number of terrorists .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
abused the asylum system '' .,Republican
examples of terrorists abusing our asylum laws : the `` blind sheik ''  sheik omar abdel rahman  led a plot to bomb new york city landmarks .,Republican
rahman used an asylum application to avoid deportation to egypt after all other means of remaining in the u.s. failed .,Republican
the 9/11 commission staff report noted than an immigration judge held a hearing on rahman 's asylum claim weeks before his followers bombed the worid trade center .,Republican
during the republican convention last august  an illegal alien from pakistan was picked up and arrested for attempting to bomb the herald square subway station and plotting to bomb the verrazano narrows bridge .,Republican
he was quoted as saying that `` i want at least 1  000 to 2  000 to die in one day.,Republican
'' the alien had applied for asylum .,Republican
a number of courts  specifically the 9th circuit court has severely undermined current authorities by limiting the factors that judges can consider when assessing the credibility of an alien seeking asylum .,Republican
this impairment encourages asylum fraud .,Republican
the real id act would strengthen judges ' ability to determine whether the asylum seeker is truthful .,Republican
this provision codifies the factors immigration judges use to assess credibility and prevents the 9th circuit from further undermining our national security .,Republican
in 1996 congress approved building the 14 mile long san diego border fence on the mexico-u.s.,Republican
border  right next to a major u.s. navy base .,Republican
the san diego sector covers an area of more than 7  000 square miles and contains 66 linear miles of international border with mexico .,Republican
directly to the south of the san diego sector area of responsibility lie the mexican cities of tijuana and tecate  which have a combined population of more than two million .,Republican
for decades  this area had been the preferred corridor for entry into the united states by unknown or undocumented persons due to the highly populated cities north and south of the border  as well as relatively quick access to national transportation hubs such as lax .,Republican
construction of the fence was halted when radical environmentalists claimed that the area was a habitat of a rare bird .,Republican
as a result  eight years later  the fence remains incomplete and is an opportunity for aliens to cross the border illegally .,Republican
this incomplete fence allows border security gaps to remain open .,Republican
we must close these gaps because they remain a threat to our national security .,Republican
the real id act will require the completion of this important security fence .,Republican
under current immigration laws  prohibitions on some terrorist-related activities only apply to aliens who are trying to enter the u.s.  but not to those who already reside within our borders .,Republican
therefore  if an alien seeking a visa has been found to participate in certain terrorist-related activity  he/she is prohibited from entering the u.s. but if an alien is found to have participated in the same terrorist activity in the u.s.  he/she may not be deportable .,Republican
the real id act would finally make the laws consistent by providing that all terrorist-related offenses and making aliens inadmissible which would also be grounds for their deportation .,Republican
the real id act provides that any alien contributing funds to a terrorist organization would be deportable .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
the real id act incorporates four of the 9/11 commission recommendations that are necessary to effectively protect our constituents from terrorists seeking to exploit loopholes in our immigration system .,Republican
this bill will close several of those dangerous loopholes .,Republican
in addition to providing important federal security guidelines for driver 's licenses  the real id act also includes other important homeland security measures  including the deportability of terrorists  preventing terrorists from gaming the asylum system  and implementing border security measures in san diego .,Republican
currently  the terrorists and their supporters can be kept out of the united states ; but as soon as they set foot into the u.s. on tourist visas  we can not deport them for many of the very same offenses .,Republican
this hinders our ability to protect americans from those alien terrorists who have infiltrated the united states .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 makes aliens deportable for the same terrorist-related offenses as those that would prevent them from being admitted to the united states in the first place .,Republican
another deficiency in current law is based on a flawed understanding of how terrorist organizations operate .,Republican
the immigration and nationality act now reads that if an alien provides funding or other material support to a terrorist organization  the alien can escape deportation if they can show that he did not know that the funds or support would further the organization 's terrorist activity ; i.e.  his donation did not immediately go to buying explosives .,Republican
as kenneth mckune  former associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the state department  explained  `` given the purposes  organizational structure  and clandestine nature of foreign terrorist organizations  it is highly likely that any material support to these organizations will ultimately inure to the benefit of their criminal  terrorist functions  regardless of whether such support was ostensibly intended to support nonviolent  nonterrorist activities.,Republican
'' money given to terrorist organizations is fungible .,Republican
senator diane feinstein has rightly stated that `` i simply do not accept that so-called humanitarian works by terrorist groups can be kept separate from their other operations .,Republican
i think the money will ultimately go to bombs and bullets rather than babies  or  because money is fungible  it will free up other funds to be used on terrorist activities.,Republican
'' the real id act is written so that an alien who provides funds or other material support to a terrorist organization would be deportable unless he did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization .,Republican
mr. chairman  i urge the support and passage of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time .,Republican
we started this fence about 20 years ago .,Republican
we started it by building the first steel fence across that 14-mile segment between the coastal hills of san diego county and the pacific ocean .,Republican
we did that because drug trucks were running that border at the rate of about 300 per month .,Republican
we had about 10 people being murdered each year  along with numerous robberies and rapes  to such a high degree that the best-selling book  `` lines and shadows '' by joseph wambaugh  was written depicting this `` no man 's land  '' where nobody wanted to be after dark .,Republican
so we built that first line  which was the steel fence right on the border .,Republican
we then built the second fence  that is  the second tier of the so-called triple fence  after we passed a law signed by president bill clinton in 1996 .,Republican
and it was president clinton who signed the bill waiving the endangered species act and waiving nepa because he thought it was so important that we have security at this  the most porous smugglers ' corridor in the united states of america .,Republican
now  i can just tell you  as a guy who has worked on this thing from the start  my staff went out and found those 79  000 steel landing mats to build this fence .,Republican
if the extremists had discovered this fence before we got the first 12 miles built  that would not be built .,Republican
we stopped those 300 drug trucks a month  stopped them dead .,Republican
we eliminated the 10 murders a year  mostly of undocumented workers .,Republican
we eliminated the hundreds of rapes of the people who were coming through there because we built that fence .,Republican
if the extremists had had their way  they would have gone to a sympathetic federal court  tied us up in lawsuits and we would not have had the fence .,Republican
the secretary of the navy has written us a letter saying that completion of this project will enhance the security of our naval installations by reducing the potential threat environment created by an unsecured border .,Republican
a few miles north of this gap in the fence is the biggest naval installation on the west coast .,Republican
through this gap have come and been apprehended people from nations that sponsor terrorists  nations like north korea  nations like syria .,Republican
this is a security issue .,Republican
and for people to say this is an environmental issue  this is the state of play right now  all these trails you see have been hammered into that ecosystem by the smugglers .,Republican
none of my colleagues have been out there trying to stop them .,Republican
they have hammered these trails by the hundreds into the ecosystem  hammered it into the marshlands and the estuary lands .,Republican
good biologists say it will take hundreds of years for these areas to be restored  not by actions of the border patrol or by our security apparatus  but by the smugglers who come across this particular gap in the fence .,Republican
we need to secure this gap .,Republican
the secretary of the navy recognizes that  president clinton recognized that and gave an unprecedented waiver .,Republican
we need to complete the border fence .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the conference agreement .,Republican
i wish to commend the conferees for their work in bringing this important legislation to the house floor .,Republican
not only does this bill provide critical support to our military and the war on terror  but it also funds international humanitarian reconstruction and economic assistance programs provided by the united states agency for international development .,Republican
as my colleagues know  i have believed for many years that the hiv/aids pandemic represents one of the greatest health and moral crises of our time  particularly in africa .,Republican
that is why i was especially pleased by the president 's announcement of a visionary emergency plan for aids relief  and have supported grants and other programs funded by usaid that help to reverse the spread of this pandemic .,Republican
it is thus my strongly held view that usaid should continue to fund existing programs  as well as invest in new programs  that support the president 's hiv/aids initiative .,Republican
in this regard  there are two programs  both directed toward south africa  that i believe deserve the agency 's particular attention .,Republican
the first program is the new african center for aids management  which has  to date  trained over 800 graduates and is the largest program of its kind worldwide .,Republican
i understand that usaid has provided only modest funding to support this initiative  while the bulk of the support has come from south african institutions .,Republican
with substantial additional support from usaid during fiscal years 2005 and 2006  this program could double in size and provide training for executives and senior managers from government  the provinces  municipalities and educational institutions  as well as ngos  corporations  and trade unions  in the management of an expanded capability to detect and treat hiv/aids in africa .,Republican
the second program would be a new joint u.s.-south african program to provide telemedicine-equipped mobile clinics to serve the south african military involved in peacekeeping efforts throughout africa .,Republican
this program  which merits both usaid and dod support  would be run through the south africa medical research council and provide medical services to remote areas to combat hiv/aids and other infectious diseases .,Republican
this mobile clinic system  employing some of the latest u.s. telemedicine technologies  would leverage u.s. military expertise across distances .,Republican
as this system develops  so would it expand in both its capabilities and its services to the civilian population .,Republican
both of these programs are examples of humanitarian initiatives requiring modest investments that usaid is both equipped and funded to support .,Republican
i applaud the agency 's past work in this area  and encourage both the continuation of existing efforts and the expansion of the new efforts that i have outlined .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to this amendment .,Republican
the asylum provisions in h.r.,Republican
418 are vitally important to protect our constituents from child molesters  rapists  murderers  and other criminals  as well as terrorists seeking asylum in our country .,Republican
i believe that we must keep the asylum open and honest for those who have a good-faith claim to asylum .,Republican
however  we must also protect our constituents from aliens who seek to abuse our asylum processes and do harm to our citizens .,Republican
for instance  because he was free after applying for asylum  mir aimal kansi was able to murder two cia employees at cia headquarters .,Republican
ramzi yousef took advantage of the freedom he gained by applying for asylum to mastermind the first world trade center attack which killed six and injured 1  000 in the amendment author 's district .,Republican
the asylum provisions in h.r.,Republican
418 do not prevent aliens from seeking asylum .,Republican
those who truly have been persecuted for religious or political grounds will be allowed to present their cases just as they are able to now .,Republican
these provisions merely overturn ninth circuit court decisions saying that immigration judges can not use inconsistencies in an alien 's statement to determine if he or she is being untruthful .,Republican
the bill also says that an asylum applicant may be asked to corroborate his claim with evidence  if such evidence can be obtained without leaving the united states .,Republican
one of the goals of this bill is to ensure that our asylum system is consistent with our judicial system .,Republican
if a judge or criminal jury can sentence a criminal defendant to life in prison or even execution because they did not believe the defendant 's story  certainly an immigration judge can deny an asylum claim to an alien for the same basis .,Republican
when an american goes to court to settle a dispute  he bears the burden of proof to prove his claim .,Republican
requiring the asylum claimant to bear the burden of proof is consistent  both with our justice system and with international law .,Republican
permitting the judge to require an asylum claimant to produce corroborating evidence he has or can obtain without leaving the united states is just common sense .,Republican
if a claimant says  for example  that he fled his country because he received a threatening letter from a government official  the judge would be remiss if he failed to ask to see the letter or at least inquire about what happened to the letter .,Republican
the asylum protections in the real id act are vitally important to ensuring the honesty of the asylum system  as well as the security of our nation and its citizens .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill  h.r.,Republican
418  and oppose this amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lantos ) xz4002310 .,Republican
mr. chairman  my amendment is offered to force the government of nigeria to transfer the indicted war criminal charles taylor to the united nations special court in sierra leone .,Republican
mr. taylor xz4003992 is currently residing in calabar  nigeria and maintaining his active role fomenting terror and crime throughout west africa from this base .,Republican
the united states government has asked that mr.,Republican
taylor xz4003992 be turned over to the u.n .,Republican
court  but the government of nigeria has refused .,Republican
charles taylor has been the leading force for evil in west africa since his overthrow of the doe government in 1990 .,Republican
hundreds of thousands of liberians were killed during his reign of terror  or forced to flee .,Republican
mr. taylor xz4003992 enabled liberia to become a base for international organized crime and has subverted the governments of his neighbors .,Republican
in 2003  mr.,Republican
taylor xz4003992 was overthrown by the people of liberia and sought sanctuary in nigeria  despite his indictment by the u.n .,Republican
special court for sierra leone in the light of his terrorist activities in his own country .,Republican
the government of nigeria has promised to keep mr.,Republican
taylor xz4003992 contained  but reliable sources have confirmed political operations in liberia  transfer assets in europe and receive funds from crime in west africa .,Republican
recently mr.,Republican
taylor xz4003992 traveled to burkina faso to meet with islamist groups in that country .,Republican
most disturbing of all  charles taylor organized and paid for an assassination attempt against the president of guinea earlier this year .,Republican
peace in west africa will not come until charles taylor is brought to justice for his crime and removed as a threat from the region .,Republican
the nigerian government must be shown that harboring a war criminal and a terrorist is not in their best interest .,Republican
i urge the house to join me in passing this amendment and standing for justice and the rule of law in west africa .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
wolf ) xz4004350 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in strong support of h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
this bill includes provisions that are essential to preventing terrorists and other criminals from obtaining fraudulent identification and provides security at our borders .,Republican
last year  congress passed legislation based on the recommendations of the 9/11 commission but failed to address vital national security and homeland security issues .,Republican
this legislation addresses theses issues and further secures our nation in a post 9/11 world .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 requires states to implement new minimum regulations for state drivers ' license and identification document security standards that must be met within 3 years .,Republican
it also establishes a process to enable states to use an existing department of transportation communication system to confirm that drivers ' licenses presented are genuine and validly issued to the person who is carrying them .,Republican
the 19 terrorists who attacked america on 9/11 had obtained over 63 valid forms of identification between them to breach our homeland security .,Republican
improving document security is necessary to counter threats from foreign terrorism .,Republican
this legislation also takes important steps regarding asylum reform .,Republican
it prevents terrorists and scam artists from abusing our asylum system and gives immigration judges the tools they need to undercut asylum fraud before it happens .,Republican
most importantly  h.r.,Republican
418 is critical to the continued construction of the southwest border fence in san diego .,Republican
despite efforts by the federal government and the border patrol  california 's coastal commission has objected to and stopped the final phase of fence construction .,Republican
completion of the fence will reduce the number of illegal crossings  and will allow the border patrol to re-deploy manpower and resources to other problem areas in san diego .,Republican
completion of the 3-mile gap in the fence  known as `` smugglers gulch  '' would be a strong step toward securing our border .,Republican
mr. chairman  i made a promise to my constituents to continue to fight for security enhancements to curb illegal immigration and secure our borders .,Republican
this legislation is essential to national security and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise to express my strong support of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
chairman sensenbrenner has presented for the consideration of the house a commonsense bill that will disrupt travel of would-be terrorists who would seek to do us harm right here in america .,Republican
when enacted  these provisions will be yet another set of effective tools to help prevent another september 11-type attack .,Republican
all of these provisions are derived from provisions of the house-passed version of h.r.,Republican
10  the 9-11 recommendations implementation act of 2004 .,Republican
during the conference with the other body on what became the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004  the provisions contained in h.r.,Republican
418 were either dropped in their entirety or modified so substantially as to virtually defeat the fundamental purpose of the provision .,Republican
a majority of the conferees on the part of the house very reluctantly agreed in order to get a conference agreement on the fundamental reform of the nation 's intelligence community .,Republican
we are all original cosponsors of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
as chairman of the conference  i thought that these provisions made sense then and they make sense now and should be enacted .,Republican
the core provisions of h.r.,Republican
418 establish a set of fundamental standards that state-issued identification cards  including driver 's license  must meet to be recognized for federal identification purposes  such as entering a federal building .,Republican
the bill provides the various states with 3 years to make any necessary modifications to their identification cards  if they so chose .,Republican
the bill provides the secretary of homeland security with discretion to extend the deadline for good cause upon application by an individual state .,Republican
the bill does not impede the authority of individual states to determine who may operate a motor vehicle or who may be issued a state personal identification card for non-federal purposes .,Republican
some argue that the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 already addresses this issue adequately .,Republican
i simply disagree .,Republican
the enacted provision requires a negotiated rulemaking process  without any absolute certitude that the negotiations on the proposed consensus regulations will be concluded by the date specified in the act .,Republican
no hard date for implementation of these fundamental standards is specified .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 also restores the authority of an immigration judge to make a determination whether to grant or deny an individual application for asylum .,Republican
at its core  the provision makes explicit the judge 's authority to assess the creditability of the assertions of oppression being made by the applicant  just as judges and juries do each day with respect to criminal defendants .,Republican
as some assert  h.r.,Republican
418 does not require the asylum applicant to produce documentary evidence in order to be granted asylum .,Republican
it grants an immigration judge the authority to request the applicant to provide evidence to support the applicant 's oral testimony and that of witnesses ' supporting the applicant .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 clearly states that the applicant is not required to provide documentary evidence if `` the applicant does not have the evidence or can not obtain the evidence without departing the united states.,Republican
'' h.r.,Republican
418 includes a provision specifying that offenses which currently provide grounds to deny a would-be terrorist entry into the united states are also grounds for the deportation of such persons  if they have somehow managed to enter the country illegally .,Republican
today  that is not the case .,Republican
this glaring gap in the law must be closed .,Republican
finally  h.r.,Republican
418 provides the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive environmental laws  so that the border fence running 14 miles east from the pacific ocean at san diego may finally be completed .,Republican
authorized by congress in 1996  it has yet to be completed because of on-going environmental litigation .,Republican
it is time to complete this much needed barrier to help secure one of the most used corridors for illegal entry  which is adjacent to the numerous facilities of the united states navy and marine corps in san diego .,Republican
mr. chairman  i commend chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership and urge my colleagues to support h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment .,Republican
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i want to address a number of numbers here .,Republican
this is a little bit about numbers  and one of them is that 121 organizations that we heard about  as if they were the ones that should obstruct the safety of 282 million americans whose lives are at risk .,Republican
another number  19 terrorist hijackers  19 .,Republican
nineteen of them with 63  another number  63 valid driver 's licenses in their possession .,Republican
any one of those driver 's licenses got them anything they needed to do in america  full rights of citizenship for that matter  and get on board any airplane .,Republican
and another number  3  000 dead americans .,Republican
and what have we done to close the door ?,Republican
anything ?,Republican
have we even said `` no '' to the 121 organizations that say  leave the door wide open  keep us at risk because somehow or another there is some kind of tone here that we object to ?,Republican
we think something is in your heart .,Republican
we need to close this door .,Republican
and what have we done ?,Republican
we have made it harder for terrorists to get on airplanes with razor blades .,Republican
we spent millions of dollars on metal detectors and millions of dollars expanding tsa and putting federal employees in place  and we put millions of people in long lines waiting to get through .,Republican
so it is a little harder for them ; they have to stand in line with the rest of us .,Republican
stand in line with the rest of us where i stand  where i see a 75-year-old lady going through a spread-eagle search while the young middle eastern male waltzes through with a smirk on his face  and we can not close that door .,Republican
this bill does some of that  not all of that  but it will be the first thing that will keep the 19-type terrorist hijackers off our airplanes  keep them out of our airplanes  out of our automobiles and provide a measure of safety and security for the american people .,Republican
it is not enough  but it is the barest of common sense  and it must move through this congress  and it must move through this congress right now  today .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the supplemental appropriations bill  and i thank the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) xz4002391 for yielding me time .,Republican
i want to commend the gentleman for putting together what i believe is an excellent bill and for his leadership in reviewing each single element of the administration 's request .,Republican
the subcommittee on transportation  treasury  and hud that i chair has mostly technical items in this supplemental that are not controversial  so i would like to focus my comments on the overall bill .,Republican
in the past few months  we have seen an extraordinary progress in iraq and in the middle east at large .,Republican
from the historic iraqi elections  the new palestinian leadership  voting in saudi arabia  and massive demonstrations in lebanon against their syrian occupiers  i believe that these events show major positive changes that can come to this part of the world .,Republican
we must maintain that momentum  and that is what this bill does .,Republican
by passing this legislation  we will keep our soldiers in iraq fully equipped as they continue their daunting task in maintaining security and training iraqis to take over those functions .,Republican
the funding included in this bill to secure a new united states embassy will help get us out of the palaces that we currently occupy .,Republican
we will provide much-needed assistance to afghanistan in its efforts to become more secure  restrict the drug trade  and develop its economy .,Republican
this is a good bill  and it deserves our support .,Republican
i would like to comment specifically on one part of the supplemental that i know many of us are concerned about  and that is the $ 200 million to aid the palestinian authority .,Republican
the palestinians have an opportunity to get their house in order  and we should help them .,Republican
prime minister abbas and finance minister fayyad are the right people for their jobs  but we all know that the palestinian authority still needs a great deal of reform  and we need to be careful about how we provide money to help the palestinians .,Republican
that is why under the direction and leadership of the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
kolbe ) xz4002260  we included specific conditions for how this money can be used .,Republican
we maintain the prohibition on direct assistance to the palestinian authority .,Republican
we require the administration to provide a comprehensive report on the steps taken by the palestinian authority on good governance  economic reforms  and dismantling the terrorist organizations .,Republican
and we require an audit of the palestinian authority 's financial structures .,Republican
providing this money sends an important signal that the u.s. is prepared to help the palestinians .,Republican
including the appropriate conditions sends an equally important signal that the palestinian authority has expectations that must be met .,Republican
the committee should be commended for handling this issue in a balanced and effective way ; and i urge everyone  obviously  to support it .,Republican
mr. chairman  again i say  this is a good bill  it is a necessary bill  and i urge again all of my colleagues to support it .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of the passage of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
many of these protections that are contained in this legislation are long overdue .,Republican
they are necessary to protect our homeland .,Republican
in particular  i am supportive of the provisions that deal with enhancing our driver 's licenses by providing for some uniformity in the standards used to issue those driver 's licenses and for finishing the border fence in southern california .,Republican
we ought not to let some vague problem of the environment keep us from finishing this important part of our border security .,Republican
but that is one step in the process of border security .,Republican
i am serious about the problem of border security .,Republican
i represent a district that has more apprehensions of illegal immigrants than any other district on the southern border  in fact  more apprehensions than all the other districts combined .,Republican
as someone working hard for a long time to help secure our border  i can confidently say the most effective and efficient way to deal with this is to have comprehensive immigration reform .,Republican
the president of the united states has recognized this .,Republican
we need to create an avenue for those not crossing for malicious reasons to be funneled through the ports-of-entry along the border .,Republican
that will allow us to deal with the real problem .,Republican
mr. chairman  i urge us to support h.r.,Republican
418  and then turn our attention to comprehensive immigration reform legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the chairman for yielding me time .,Republican
i thank the chairman for leading on this most important issue .,Republican
on september 11  our nation suffered the most horrible attack ever on american soil at the hands of those with a deep-seated  enduring hatred for freedom .,Republican
since that day  we have made great strides in improving our nation 's security  but several gaps leave our nation vulnerable to attacks  just like those we suffered that day .,Republican
the real id bill would close loopholes and make americans more secure .,Republican
the situation in california where a state environmental commission is blocking a national security barrier from being finished must be remedied .,Republican
a 3-mile gap remains in a fence which would prevent people from crossing over our southern border in an area that is home to a military base .,Republican
half a million people are caught there each year trying to get across  and that does not include those who get on through .,Republican
they are their own environmental problem as well .,Republican
the real id bill would give the secretary of homeland security the authority he needs to ensure that our national security is not compromised for dubious environmental concerns .,Republican
our asylum system presently welcomes fraud by those who seek to do our nation harm .,Republican
the real id bill would allow our immigration judges to use common sense to protect americans while still providing a safe harbor for those who truly need refuge in our country .,Republican
it is outrageous that we can keep people out of this country based upon terrorist links  but the minute they are in this country  we can not deport them .,Republican
the real id bill would fix this problem  which poses a great danger to our citizens .,Republican
perhaps most importantly  our nation 's security will remain at risk so long as we give validity to those who are in our nation illegally in the form of state driver 's licenses and other id 's .,Republican
driver 's licenses in our country are de facto id cards .,Republican
they allow people to blend in  move freely  rent apartments  go to work  board airplanes .,Republican
if states do not require some valid form of u.s. government-issued id to get a driver 's license  any person could walk in off the street and claim to be a legal alien in search of a license  and be granted one .,Republican
to say that this is not an issue of national security is beyond the limits of reasonability .,Republican
the real id bill would ensure those to whom we issue government ids and driver 's licenses are in the u.s. legally and make it more likely that those to whom we issue id 's do not intend to harm americans .,Republican
we must close these loopholes .,Republican
i thank the chairman and i ask the congress to act .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself of such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the chairman of the full committee for indulging me with this amendment .,Republican
this amendment was legislation which was introduced by several of us that represent border districts last year as a freestanding bill .,Republican
it is now incorporated here in this bill  or parts of it at least are incorporated in this bill .,Republican
i think it is entirely consistent with the goals of h.r.,Republican
418  because a key component of securing our borders is increasing technology and communication along the border regions .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 is a bill about securing our homeland  and this amendment is a perfect complement to the vision of this very important legislation offered by the gentleman from wisconsin .,Republican
arizona has become a doormat for illegal immigrants .,Republican
they pour across our porous border every day .,Republican
in fact  there are more apprehensions of illegal immigrants in arizona than the entire rest of the border combined .,Republican
many portions of the arizona border are large and unpopulated desolate desert areas .,Republican
they are hard to patrol and difficult to monitor .,Republican
in these areas and all along the border it is essential to advance ground technologies in order to officially understand and stop those who come through this back door to our nation .,Republican
my amendment to h.r.,Republican
418 requires the department of homeland security  working through the field offices of the bureau of customs and border protection  to get the technology  the equipment and the personnel needed to address security of our borders .,Republican
furthermore  the amendment requires that the department of homeland security carry out ground surveillance programs that will improve border security .,Republican
while the national intelligence reform act of 2004 designed a plan to enhance ground surveillance on the northern border  a similar program was not designed for the southern border .,Republican
improvements to ground technologies are absolutely essential in the large expanses of desert and unpopulated lands along the southern border .,Republican
finally  this amendment requires the department of homeland security to improve communications and information sharing with federal  state and tribal government agencies .,Republican
the various agencies with jurisdiction over the southern border must be able to communicate .,Republican
this is particularly a problem in arizona  because more than half of the entire border is covered by tribal organizations  tribal units  sovereign tribal nations who are not generally covered by most of the federal legislation we have on telecommunication sharing .,Republican
having customs agents unable to communicate with border patrol agents or with the policemen from the tohono o'odham nation around the same port of entry is really quite ridiculous .,Republican
this portion of the amendment addresses problems with the use of incompatible communications technologies and requires that the department of homeland security rectify this situation .,Republican
the amendment builds on the sentiment  it builds on the intention of h.r.,Republican
418  and through its enhancement of homeland security helps to ensure the safety and defense of our nation .,Republican
i think it will be a step  perhaps a small step  but one of the very important steps along our southern border to helping improve the technology and our ability to secure that southern border .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
i want to congratulate the gentleman on this  his first bill to be brought to the floor of the house of representatives .,Republican
i think it is indicative of the good work that he and his staff are doing .,Republican
mr. chairman  i want to talk about the funding of programs that are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee that i chair  that is  the subcommittee on foreign operations  export financing and related programs .,Republican
it totals $ 2.7 billion .,Republican
however  approximately $ 1 billion of that is offset with a cut to previously appropriated funds .,Republican
the remaining $ 1.75 billion is provided as emergency spending and includes $ 656 million for tsunami recovery .,Republican
the committee 's overall recommendation for all the programs under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on foreign operations  export financing and related programs is $ 1.2 billion less than the president requested .,Republican
however  with the $ 1 billion offset  less than half of the president 's request will impact the federal deficit .,Republican
let me say once again that i do strongly support the objectives that the president seeks to achieve with this request as it relates to afghanistan  the middle east  the ukraine and the tsunami-devastated areas of asia .,Republican
but i did tell chairman lewis that i would scrutinize this request  and the result of that scrutiny is what is before the members today .,Republican
we have assigned the highest priority to programs that can be implemented and executed during 2005 and that are not likely to be funded by other donors .,Republican
the resulting recommendation is a balanced approach to supporting the president 's request and provides much-needed emergency appropriations to further the fight against terror and provide disaster assistance .,Republican
let me explain further the recommendation for the programs under the foreign operations jurisdiction .,Republican
we broke the president 's request down into three different categories .,Republican
the first includes programs that are true emergencies  such as replenishment of funds that were reprogrammed previously for tsunami disaster assistance and poppy eradication in afghanistan  funds for the humanitarian crisis in darfur and in asia  and funds to train afghan police  funds that are necessary to improve conditions that would enable us to bring our troops home as soon as possible .,Republican
total emergency spending under this first category is $ 1.75 billion  as i already indicated .,Republican
the second category of funds includes those programs requested by the president that we have determined to not be an emergency  but are important to u.s. leadership abroad .,Republican
additionally  this category includes reconstruction resources to stabilize and improve conditions in afghanistan and the middle east which support our efforts to bring our troops home  funds to support the democratic movement and government in ukraine  and funds for programs in the west bank and gaza .,Republican
we have provided $ 995 million in this second category of nonemergency spending and have offset these funds with the rescission of prior foreign assistance appropriations  specifically funds that were appropriated for turkey in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental bill .,Republican
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan .,Republican
our leadership can have positive influence in both the west bank and gaza  in ukraine  in indonesia and sri lanka and  of course  in afghanistan .,Republican
i saw a press report recently from indonesia  the world 's most populous muslim country  that showed that the backing for osama bin laden had dropped from 58 percent in 2003 to 23 percent today .,Republican
i believe part of that is due to the efficiency and the generosity of u.s. relief efforts after the december tsunami .,Republican
as chairman of the foreign operations  export financing and related programs subcommittee  i am repeatedly reminded of how much we as a nation do each year to provide disaster assistance and relief .,Republican
it is encouraging to know that at least one important muslim country has started to take notice .,Republican
finally  the last category includes programs requested by the administration that we determined were less urgent and could be considered in the 2006 budget process .,Republican
this category totals $ 1.2 billion in funding and includes fiscal year 2006 operating costs of our programs overseas and large construction projects that can either wait for consideration or would have a possible revenue stream  making them ideal projects for world bank and asian development bank funding .,Republican
these programs total $ 616 million for afghanistan  $ 200 million for the new global war on terror partners fund  the new $ 200 million solidarity fund  and $ 45 million in debt relief for countries affected by the december tsunami .,Republican
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil .,Republican
it is also a responsibility to our future .,Republican
we must not be faced 20 years in the future with the knowledge that we looked at the opportunities of a taliban-free afghan government  a democracy-oriented government in the ukraine  a middle east craving freedom and representative government  only to turn away and leave them to their own meager means with no u.s. influence .,Republican
mr. chairman  i urge that this legislation be adopted .,Republican
i believe that this is a good bill and a well written one .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
flake ) xz4001340 .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  can the gentlewoman clarify which amendment we are talking about here ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Republican
as the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Republican
jackson ) xz4001980 knows  i spoke in committee against this amendment which was then part of a larger amendment and these two were combined at that point .,Republican
i made the point that i was not at all sure that this additional money was needed in darfur  sudan in light of the amount of money that is already in the 2005 bill and the amount of money that is in the supplemental for this region .,Republican
however  i understand the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Republican
jackson ) xz4001980 feels very strongly about this .,Republican
he and i traveled together to the darfur region .,Republican
we saw the terrible  terrible suffering that the people there are going through .,Republican
we are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area  but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region  and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment  and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point .,Republican
we will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle on this at that point .,Republican
i again want to commend the gentleman for his commitment  his dedication  his passion in offering this amendment today .,Republican
mr. speaker  i wanted to come to the floor today to speak in favor of reforming our system for asylum and against the move to strike the necessary reforms incorporated in h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
it has been suggested throughout out this debate yesterday and today that because there is no specific recommendation made by the 9-11 commission to reform our asylum system that we in congress should do nothing to fix it .,Republican
that in my opinion is insane .,Republican
my colleagues and friends on the other side of the isle suggest we stick our heads in the sand and ignore one of the tools used by terrorists to gain access to and remain in our country .,Republican
make no mistake  the 9-11 commission report does specifically state that our asylum system was and is used by terrorists to carry out their schemes to kill americans .,Republican
let me quote from the report and its accompanying statements : the report states  speaking of the first trade center bombing  `` ... ..ramazi yousef  who had also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was admitted .,Republican
it quickly became clear that yousef had been a central player in the attack .,Republican
he had fled to pakistan immediately after the bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years.,Republican
'' later in the report it talks about the outdated immigration benefits system  `` ... ..when doris meissner became ins commissioner in 1993  she found ... .. the asylum and other benefits systems did not effectively deter fraudulent applicants .,Republican
finally  `` terrorists in the 1990s  as well as the september 11 hijackers  needed to find a way to stay in or embed themselves in the united states if their operational plans were to come to fruition.,Republican
'' `` this could be accomplished ... .. by applying for asylum after entering .,Republican
in many cases  the act of filing for an immigration benefit ( such as claiming asylum ) sufficed to permit the alien to remain in the country until the petition was adjudicated .,Republican
terrorists were free to conduct surveillance  coordinate operations  obtain and receive funding  go to school and learn english  make contacts in the united states  acquire necessary materials  and execute an attack.,Republican
'' so  if i am to understand my friends on the other side  we are to ignore the problem of asylum abuse and do nothing .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am now clear which amendment we are talking about .,Republican
i appreciate the gentlewoman yielding for that purpose .,Republican
is that the one we are considering ?,Republican
is that the understanding of the chair ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i strongly oppose this amendment .,Republican
i think most of my colleagues know that there were at least 225  000  maybe many more than that  people who were killed in the countries affected by the december 2004 tsunami  most particularly indonesia  sri lanka  india and other countries as well .,Republican
there were 1.1 million displaced persons  1.1 million displaced persons .,Republican
this is a disaster and it is an emergency .,Republican
the president has outlined a recovery plan .,Republican
this amendment  although it does not strike the dollars  makes funding ineligible to be spent for these purposes .,Republican
some of these funds would go to reimburse accounts already depleted  usaid accounts  emergency disaster relief accounts  that have been previously spent .,Republican
so it is very important that we retain those accounts and that we retain the money for those .,Republican
the rest of the funds are for a reconstruction plan that has been i think fairly well thought out .,Republican
it is not  i do not think  extraordinary given the size of the catastrophe that we have experienced  $ 340 million to rebuild infrastructure  roads  ports  bridges  water treatment plants and a signature project which would be the construction of a 250 kilometer stretch of road from the capital  banda aceh  at the north end of sumatra down the west coast to meulaboh in indonesia .,Republican
this road is the only link that these little communities that are utterly devastated and destroyed by the tsunami -- this road is the only link that these communities will have with the outside world .,Republican
these reconstruction projects needs to get under way immediately .,Republican
until that happens  the only contact  the only way to get relief supplies to these little valleys which on the back side has a very high ridge of mountains and no access by road  the only way to get supplies to them is by air or by sea  a very expensive project .,Republican
the road needs to be constructed .,Republican
i think it is an emergency and i believe most of my colleagues would agree with that .,Republican
the u.s. has had a history of responding in a very compassionate way to disasters wherever they occur  here in the united states and also abroad  and i believe that this compassion is something that marks americans and makes us who we are .,Republican
and i would certainly hope that my colleagues would agree that these funds are a relatively small amount of money  given the total level of devastation of the disaster there  a relatively small amount of money to help this area recover and to replenish the money that was already spent in relief .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i just want to clarify one point the gentleman from massachusetts made about the $ 8.8 billion  and i just think we members need to understand we are talking about funds that came not from the united states taxpayers  but those $ 8.8 billion are funds from the iraqi fund  which was iraqi dinars that had been collected as a result of oil sales .,Republican
it was a chaotic situation at the end of the war  as we all know  and ministries had collapsed .,Republican
there was no communication .,Republican
there were no accounting systems .,Republican
the bureaucrats had not functioned for years .,Republican
it was very difficult  at the very best  to know how to handle those in the very best way .,Republican
it was really a choice of whether or not we were going to get the projects done as quickly as possible and get the country functioning again .,Republican
so i think  to me  the choice was fairly clear .,Republican
i just want to make people understand we are not talking about u.s. dollars when we talk about the 8.8 .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Republican
yes  mr.,Republican
chairman .,Republican
i make the point of order  as the chairman of the full committee has said on several occasions .,Republican
i am more than sympathetic .,Republican
he is more than sympathetic to some of these amendments .,Republican
i especially feel that way with this amendment  given the fact that it deals with something that is very dear to me  the issue of border security .,Republican
however  i would make a point of order against the amendment which is not the humdrum of little technicalities .,Republican
this is the rules of the house .,Republican
it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and  therefore  violates clause 2 of rule xxi .,Republican
the rule states in pertinent part that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if in changing existing law it gives affirmative direction in effect .,Republican
this amendment would do that  and i ask for a ruling from the chair .,Republican
mr. chairman  i think i heard the reading of two amendments .,Republican
which one are we on here at this point ?,Republican
are we on the one that is $ 3 million or the one that was the larger one that i heard read first ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for this bill  especially for its iraqi dollars  because this bill analyzes microscopically the kinds of equipment that is needed there now  and then surgically targets those dollars in a vastly efficient manner for our troops .,Republican
the bill also deals with healing the wounds of both mind and body of those soldiers who are returning .,Republican
the bill also deals with small businesses being able  through the h-2b process  to hire legal workers .,Republican
and the bill also deals with enhanced technology for the tsunami situation that we saw so much  months ago .,Republican
i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) for the legislation  and i urge its adoption .,Republican
mr. speaker  i would like to address the $ 17 million included in the supplemental that we are considering today  which will support the expansion of the u.s. tsunami warning network .,Republican
these funds will help noaa to procure and deploy tsunami detection buoys in a system designed to provide continuous tsunami warning capability for both the pacific and atlantic coasts of the united states .,Republican
detection is a critical part of a warning system which i hope will ultimately include a comprehensive approach to educating communities about  and preparing them for  tsunamis .,Republican
comprising 70 percent of the earth 's surface area  our oceans support a growing source of protein for many developing countries  promising sources of medicines  and efficient transport of goods between continents and among nations .,Republican
they also strongly influence our climate and weather and provide economic and unmeasurable quality of life benefits .,Republican
for proof of this  one only needs to know that the u.s. coasts support over 50 percent of the u.s. population and comprise only 17 percent of our land base .,Republican
when south asia was struck by tsunami waves on december 26  the world 's interest in tsunami detection and warning systems was heightened .,Republican
the impact of these waves was felt around the world  and the tragedy of its immediate effect on indian ocean coastlines has painfully exposed our lack of ability to provide early warning and coastal community education and support .,Republican
many lifelong residents of indian ocean coastal towns fear the sea -- the primary source of their livelihoods for generations .,Republican
it is critical that individuals in high-risk areas are educated about and prepared for tsunamis before they strike .,Republican
coastal communities need assurance that technology exists and will be applied to increase warnings for such events and to prepare them for evacuation to avoid catastrophic loss of human life .,Republican
in contrast  developed nations use increasing technological sophistication to acquire from the sea its bounty -- with little thought for the long-term sustainability of this activity .,Republican
in time  without increased understanding of our ocean ecosystems and the impact of our harvest and extraction of its resources  developed nations may also come to fear the sea .,Republican
the antidote to the disease of fear is understanding .,Republican
new technologies have already led to enormous advances in our understanding of the coastal and marine environment .,Republican
however  advanced sensors have been deployed only on relatively small scales  and the systems that are deployed have not been coordinated into an integrated system that will optimize our understanding of the oceans .,Republican
since the u.s. hosted the earth observation summit in july 2003  we have been working with our partner nations to adopt a comprehensive  coordinated and sustained earth observation system to collect and disseminate data  information and models for more effective and responsible use of our resources as well as to inform decision-makers about impending disasters .,Republican
most recently  the u.s. commission on ocean policy made an integrated ocean observing system a top recommendation in its report  an ocean blueprint for the 21st century .,Republican
our space exploration and our weather programs show that when our scientists and the nation support a program and devote time  money and  most importantly  the human mind into these types of endeavors we are highly successful .,Republican
the ocean  however  is often referred to as the last frontier  a place where we continue to find new organisms and species and where we still struggle to understand the profound implications for climate changes and more direct impacts of the oceans on our human habitats .,Republican
there is perhaps no more motivating event  no louder a voice for attention and understanding than having the ocean engulf human habitats .,Republican
our failure to fully develop and utilize our technology to understand our oceans has many more implications  including the potential for permanent damage to fragile and complex ecosystems that have generously provided us with food  medicines  recreation  and other benefits .,Republican
we are now awake to the power of the ocean  and it is my hope that we will use this opportunity to move more quickly toward integrated data collection and dissemination systems  as well as intensive education of coastal communities  to ensure that we and future generations can look to the sea for inspiration  sustenance  and life-giving support .,Republican
i strongly support the inclusion of these funds to increase global monitoring capacity and public awareness about tsunamis and other disasters  particularly if they add to capacity of ocean monitoring as part of the global earth observation system of systems ( geoss ) .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910 .,Republican
that is correct .,Republican
when you make the unanimous consent request  it is all amendments to this amendment .,Republican
if the gentleman will yield  of his 5 minutes  that is correct .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from arizona .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment  and any amendments thereto  be limited to 10 minutes  to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself  the opponent .,Republican
mr. chairman  i have looked at the amendment  and i understand what the gentlewoman is talking about  what her intentions or how it would be used in the tsunami recovery fund .,Republican
it does not  of course  specifically provide for that  and i am prepared to accept this amendment if the gentlewoman would be willing to move the discussion along as quickly as possible .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment  and since the gentleman from texas has already spoken  i do not know whether he intends to speak again before i make the point of order or whether he is prepared to go forward at this time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i move to strike the requisite number of words .,Republican
out of deference to the chairman  i will be very brief  but i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
tierney ) xz4004070 for raising this at this time ; and he has done a wonderful job in leading this effort .,Republican
i would just like to stress the dual dimension of bipartisanship of this amendment .,Republican
one  its legislative approach was introduced in the last congress  and with the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
tierney ) xz4004070 i reintroduced it in this congress .,Republican
secondly  as we think back to the truman commission  which the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
tierney ) xz4004070 referenced  it is very impressive that that commission was established by the party in power at the time  and so it was the party in power that wanted to look at itself .,Republican
thirdly  the truman commission was established at a time that senator truman was very concerned that a very small number of contracts were let to a very small number of companies in a very narrow part of the country .,Republican
at the time  he was concerned about american manufacturing being held by too few in a contract sense .,Republican
now we are looking at services where it looks like a very small number of companies have gotten very large contracts .,Republican
it is more complicated today because  in addition  some contracts are going to foreign firms .,Republican
so this is a very delicate area .,Republican
i personally believe that the only way you can maintain a support for national policy  however controversial  is to have complete confidence that things are being pursued in the most honest way possible .,Republican
i think the time has come for this type of approach .,Republican
i would hope this congress would look at it .,Republican
mr. chairman  i just want to say i think this is about as dumb a thing as we can do .,Republican
i think to take the money away from people who are doing the hard work  these are our people .,Republican
these are people that are there because they care about our country and they care about freedom and they care about bringing hope and opportunity to the people of iraq .,Republican
and the idea that we do not want to provide safe haven to them and the idea that we want to micromanage where this place is going to be is nonsense .,Republican
we can not do that .,Republican
we are asking people to go over there and bring hope and freedom and opportunity .,Republican
these are americans .,Republican
these are people that we sent there .,Republican
and so we are saying to them that we do not want to give them safe haven ; we do not want to give them an opportunity to have a safe place to live and do their work  the work that we have asked them to do ?,Republican
we need an embassy there .,Republican
i can not think of a dumber thing that we could do as to take this money away and to try and micromanage the way that we are going to establish an embassy and an opportunity for people to live safely over there .,Republican
those of you that have been there know what a dangerous place it is .,Republican
these are the people that are doing the hard work .,Republican
i would urge every member to vote against this amendment and to send a message to the americans that are over there  the people that are doing the hard work to bring democracy  we care about their safety  we care about the work they are doing .,Republican
vote against the upton amendment and say to our friends over there  we care about your safety  we care about what you are doing  and we thank you for the tough  tough job you are doing in an area that is probably as dangerous as anywhere in the world .,Republican
vote against the upton amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  first of all  i want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee on this  his maiden effort  to bring a major supplemental appropriation to the floor as chairman  and i congratulate him for the leadership that he has shown in bringing this so swiftly to this floor .,Republican
i do rise in support of the conference report to h.r.,Republican
1268 .,Republican
before i address the funding that is the responsibility of my subcommittee  i want to briefly acknowledge a critically important part of this bill  border security funding .,Republican
the securing of our nation 's borders to prevent the hemorrhaging flow of illegal immigration through my state of arizona has got to be a top priority for the federal government .,Republican
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system  and we must address gaps in border security now .,Republican
arizona and other border states can no longer serve as the back door for this country 's broken immigration system .,Republican
by adding the funding that we do in this bill  we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected .,Republican
regarding the foreign operations  export financing  and related programs subcommittee chapter of this legislation  the conference report includes $ 2.53 billion in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations  export financing  and related programs subcommittee  which i chair .,Republican
while this overall level is $ 1.4 billion less than requested  let me say once again i strongly support the objectives of the president that he seeks to achieve with this request for afghanistan  the middle east  and the tsunami-devastated areas of asia .,Republican
i believe that this conference agreement provides the financial support necessary to help the united states achieve these objectives .,Republican
the major elements of the conference agreement that differ from the house-passed levels are additional funds for afghanistan reconstruction  the solidarity initiative  and support for ukraine .,Republican
the $ 739 million proposed by the house for afghanistan reconstruction represented the highest priority projects that could be implemented and executed during 2005 .,Republican
the senate provided $ 1.3 billion  the administration 's request .,Republican
and the conference level is $ 1.086 billion  or $ 347 million over what the house had recommended .,Republican
this increase over the house level supports some 2006 requirements  which is  i believe  a cost-effective approach to the 2006 budget process .,Republican
the house provided no funding for the administration 's $ 400 million solidarity initiative .,Republican
the senate provide a total of $ 225.5 million  $ 200 million in the solidarity fund and $ 25.5 million in the global war on terror partners fund .,Republican
the conference agreement provides a total of $ 230 million  merging the two funds into one appropriation  and places these funds within peacekeeping operations appropriations .,Republican
this arrangement provides for regular order congressional review of the department 's plans for these funds .,Republican
the conference agreement provides $ 60 million for ukraine  and these funds will support the government of ukraine 's highest priorities for political and economic reform  including anti-corruption initiatives and support for the upcoming parliamentary elections .,Republican
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan .,Republican
this agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to promote democracy and provide the state department with programs and projects to support these positive influences .,Republican
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil .,Republican
however  congress has the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and transparently  and we take that responsibility seriously with reporting requirements  and we will continue vigorous oversight of these programs .,Republican
the greatest weight all of us must bear is the knowledge that these decisions we make directly put the lives of americans at risk .,Republican
i firmly believe the bill before us today will help build stability and freedom in afghanistan  the middle east  and parts of asia .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on h.r.,Republican
1268 .,Republican
i rise in support of the conference report to h.r.,Republican
1268  a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005 .,Republican
before i address the funding in my subcommittee  i wanted to briefly acknowledge a critically important part of this bill -- border security funding .,Republican
the securing of our nation 's borders to prevent the hemorrhaging flow of illegal immigration through my state of arizona must be a top priority for the federal government .,Republican
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system  and we must address gaps in border security now .,Republican
arizona and other border states can no longer serve as the backdoor for this country 's broken immigration system .,Republican
by adding this funding we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected .,Republican
i am pleased that my colleagues on the conference committee agreed to provide $ 635 million for border security to hire an additional 500 border patrol agents  50 additional criminal investigators  168 immigration enforcement agents and deportation officers  and to fund 1  950 additional detention beds .,Republican
the bill also includes my amendment to strengthen the real id act to address the technology  equipment  and personnel needs improving security within the u.s.  requiring department of homeland security to carry out an improved ground surveillance program  and requiring dhs to improve interagency communication .,Republican
regarding the foreign operations subcommittee chapter  the conference agreement includes $ 2.532 billion  in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations subcommittee of which i am chairman .,Republican
this amount is $ 685 million over the house level  $ 251 million less than the senate level  and $ 1.4 billion less than the administration 's request .,Republican
while this overall level is $ 1.4 billion less than requested  let me say once again that i strongly support the objectives the president seeks to achieve with this request for afghanistan  the middle east  and the tsunami devastated areas of asia .,Republican
i believe that  with the understanding that we need to reduce our federal deficit  this conference agreement provides the financial support necessary to help the united states achieve these objectives .,Republican
the major elements of the conference agreement that differ from the house passed-level are : additional funds for afghanistan reconstruction  the solidarity initiative  and support for ukraine .,Republican
the $ 739 million proposed by the house for afghanistan reconstruction  represented the highest priority projects that could be implemented and executed during 2005 .,Republican
the senate provided $ 1.3 billion  the administration 's request .,Republican
the conference level is $ 1.086 billion  $ 347 million over the house recommendation .,Republican
the increase over the house level supports some 2006 requirements -- a cost effective approach to the 2006 budget process -- such as $ 101.4 million for two additional power plants  $ 8.4 million for a water pipeline  $ 72 million for additional roads and infrastructure  and $ 43 million for economic governance .,Republican
the house provided no funding for the administration 's $ 400 million `` solidarity initiative.,Republican
'' the solidarity initiative request of $ 400 million for two $ 200 million funds to be used by the secretary of state  as she determines  was to offset the costs of those countries that have dedicated troops to the global war on terror as well as economic support to other nations that have provided support .,Republican
the senate provided a total of $ 225.5 million -- $ 200 million in the solidarity fund and $ 25.5 million in the global war on terror partners fund .,Republican
the conference agreement provides a total of $ 230 million  merging the two funds into one appropriation and places these funds within the peacekeeping operations appropriations .,Republican
this arrangement provides for regular order congressional review of the department 's plans for these funds .,Republican
this will provide sufficient oversight of a substantial amount of money for the global war on terror .,Republican
the house provided $ 33.7 million for support to ukraine .,Republican
the senate provided the administration 's request of $ 60 million .,Republican
the conference agreement provides $ 60 million for ukraine .,Republican
these funds will support the government of ukraine 's highest priorities for political and economic reform  including anti-corruption initiatives and support for the upcoming parliamentary elections .,Republican
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan .,Republican
u.s. leadership can have positive  democratic influence in the west bank  gaza  lebanon  belarus  and ukraine .,Republican
this agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to promote democracy and provide state department with programs and projects to support these positive influences .,Republican
finally  the conference agreement provides $ 656 million for assistance to the victims of the tsunami and earthquakes of last december and march .,Republican
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil .,Republican
however  congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and transparently  and i know my colleagues take that responsibility seriously .,Republican
we have included financial reporting requirements for all funds in the foreign operations chapter .,Republican
for afghanistan counternarcotics and west bank gaza programs  we have included additional auditing requirements .,Republican
as chairman  i pledge to continue vigorous oversight of these programs .,Republican
the greatest weight all of us must bear is the knowledge that decisions we make as members of congress directly puts the lives of americans at risk .,Republican
already  men and women from probably every district represented today have made the ultimate sacrifice in iraq and afghanistan .,Republican
i firmly believe the bill before us today will help to build stability and freedom in afghanistan  the middle east and parts of asia .,Republican
again  i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on passage of the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on h.r.,Republican
1268 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the chairman .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from arizona .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself 3 minutes .,Republican
mr. chairman  i really do not understand the need for this amendment that is offered by the gentleman from new york .,Republican
surely as he knows  there are not any funds in this bill for saudi arabia in the foreign operations chapter .,Republican
additionally  there are reporting requirements to ensure that the funds are spent exactly as the committee intends .,Republican
we do not intend that any of the funds should go to saudi arabia .,Republican
so the gentleman from new york is incorrect when he says this is similar to the legislation that was passed last year on the regular appropriation bill .,Republican
there was some money in last year 's bill that went to saudi arabia .,Republican
this bill does not have any money for saudi arabia  so it is completely unnecessary .,Republican
it is a gratuitous kind of amendment .,Republican
it i would also point out  as i just mentioned  that we included the prohibition in the 2005 regular appropriation bill .,Republican
section 575 of public law 108-447 states : `` none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to that act shall be obligated or expended to finance any assistance to saudi arabia.,Republican
'' the prohibition that is in that legislation extends to the fiscal year 2005 supplemental bills .,Republican
supplemental legislation includes appropriations that are added on top of the regular appropriations .,Republican
so the underlying prohibition also applies here .,Republican
there are no funds in this bill that could be used for saudi arabia .,Republican
this is simply repeating something that has already been added into the regular legislation .,Republican
the gentleman from new york is simply wrong when he says that the president could come and reprogram funds for saudi arabia .,Republican
the underlying prohibition would prohibit that .,Republican
the administration can reprogram funds  but they can not reprogram them to spend them in saudi arabia .,Republican
the gentleman is simply wrong about that .,Republican
i am sure the gentleman is aware of these facts and i am sure he is aware  as he has pointed out  of how helpful saudi arabia has been very recently in helping to defuse the situation in lebanon  the very direct statements that were made to president assad about how his troops should depart from lebanon .,Republican
if the gentleman wants to make his statement  fine  i would encourage him to do so ; but the appropriation bills include the substance of what is in his amendment ; and since there is no money in this bill for saudi arabia  this amendment is not only redundant  it is unnecessary  it is a slap in the face  it is just simply absolutely wrong for us to do this .,Republican
i strongly urge the defeat of this amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  it is with great pride that i bring before the house h.r.,Republican
1268  a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005 .,Republican
this is my first appropriations measure as the new appropriations committee chairman .,Republican
i am especially proud of the extraordinary effort put forth by the committee 's members and staff to report a bill that will better permit our troops to prosecute the war on terrorism and will do so with a price tag less than that requested by the president .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would like to have the house pay special attention to three of my colleagues who have come back from the private sector to help serve this committee .,Republican
frank cushing is my staff director  and david lesstrang and jeff shockey are my deputy staff directors for the committee .,Republican
i really appreciate their willingness to make great sacrifice to come back .,Republican
six of the committee 's 10 subcommittees participated in the development of this measure which provides $ 81.27 billion in urgent and emergency spending .,Republican
the lion 's share of that amount  some $ 76.8 billion  is for defense-related expenditures .,Republican
this funding represents an increase for defense needs of $ 1.8 billion above the president 's request  which i hasten to note is entirely for enhanced support for deployed  soon-to-be deployed  or returning troops in order to assist in force protection and to increase the survivability of the troops in the field .,Republican
to provide these important resources for our troops  we reduced other  nonessential dod requests by some $ 600 million as well as nearly $ 1 billion in foreign assistance-related programs that were either not well justified or did not meet the strict definition we applied for emergency spending .,Republican
in addition  another $ 1 billion of extremely important and time-sensitive non-emergency foreign assistance approved by the committee was completely offset by a rescission of funds originally appropriated in fiscal year 2003 .,Republican
with my colleagues ' indulgence  i would like to take a few moments to give the house a flavor of the urgent procurement needs that the committee has included in the measure for our troops .,Republican
those include up-armored humvees and other new humvees  medium and heavy trucks  night vision devices  handheld stand-off mine detection systems  jammers  improved high-frequency radios  strykers to replace combat losses  add-on armor kits  small-arms modifications and ammunition  body armor for both the army and marine corps  and medical supplies .,Republican
in addition to our providing these necessary resources for our troops  the committee was compelled to fully fund the army 's modularity program at this time because of the urgency to address the significant challenges the army now faces in mitigating stress on the current active duty combat force .,Republican
to meet this problem  the army will not only create 10 additional combat brigades ; all of the current combat brigades will be redesigned to enhance their ability to deploy more rapidly and operate more independently on the battlefield .,Republican
i might add that our determination to procure additional equipment beyond the president 's request will allow forthcoming troop rotations to receive much of their equipment prior to deployment  clearly an obvious benefit to the success of our troops .,Republican
beyond the requirements of our defense community  the bill provides $ 656 million to meet the human needs resulting from last december 's horrific tsunami .,Republican
in addition  the bill includes $ 592 million for the construction of the u.s. embassy compound in baghdad .,Republican
while that money for the embassy is a reduction of some $ 66 million  or 10 percent  from the president 's request  construction of the embassy compound has been deemed urgent because of the imminent security threats to some 4  000 u.s. personnel in iraq .,Republican
thus far  45 personnel with the u.s. mission in iraq have been killed  including two american citizens who were killed by a rocket attack on our diplomatic compound the day of the iraqi elections .,Republican
providing the funds now will greatly reduce the amount of time our personnel remain in harm 's way .,Republican
despite the additional needs we have recommended on behalf of our troops  the committee 's bill is $ 614 million less than that requested by the president .,Republican
this reduction comes largely as a result of reductions in proposed foreign assistance spending .,Republican
mr. chairman  i believe this measure is responsible both in how we have responded to the needs to provide for adequate resources in making this fight against terrorism and also in how we have carefully scrubbed each and every program so that we can say with utmost assurance that this is a fiscally sound piece of legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  as i close my remarks  i wish to express my deep appreciation for my ranking member from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000  as well as to each and every member of the committee .,Republican
i have already expressed my feelings about our staff on both sides of the aisle .,Republican
all of them have worked so diligently to prepare effectively this legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  as i mentioned at the outset  i am very proud of this measure i bring to you  my first measure as chairman of the committee on appropriations .,Republican
i certainly urge the members to adopt this bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
kolbe ) xz4002260 .,Republican
i appreciate my colleague yielding .,Republican
i know he will continue with his statement .,Republican
i want the body to know that i very much share his concern .,Republican
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) and i have discussed this issue .,Republican
he expresses his concern very clearly ; as did the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
young ) .,Republican
it has been my privilege to work with the gentleman for years  and i know of his commitment to the department and our work .,Republican
indeed the administration does owe us the courtesy of adequate and appropriate response time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i appreciate the gentleman raising this point  and i want to make it very clear that religious organizations may compete on an equal footing for usaid funding in this bill  as they may for usaid funding in other bills .,Republican
so the answer to the gentleman 's question is yes .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
wolf ) xz4004350 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware of it because he does not serve on those subcommittees  but there were at least six hearings in a variety of subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i have no additional speakers .,Republican
i will make closing remarks on the general debate .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Republican
knollenberg ) xz4002250  the chairman of the subcommittee on transportation  treasury  and hud .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
having no additional speakers under general debate  i would just like to close by saying that the discussion we have had thus far on this very important measure has been very healthy .,Republican
the fundamental thrust of this supplemental is to support the troops in iraq and in the middle east .,Republican
we do have funds that involve the terrible tragedy  the tsunami .,Republican
the discussion will lead to amendments that will round out this debate .,Republican
i expect it will be a very efficient  hopefully very speedy  debate .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
at this point i see none on the floor .,Republican
mr. chairman  i do .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill and  therefore  violates clause 2 of rule xxi .,Republican
the rule states in pertinent part : an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law .,Republican
the amendment gives affirmative direction in effect .,Republican
i ask a ruling from the chair .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment in no small part because essentially the tierney amendment would be changing the rules of the house .,Republican
that is above the purview of the committee on appropriations  at least of this chairman of the committee on appropriations .,Republican
because of that  i would oppose the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i withdraw my point of order .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
young ) xz4004391 .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
of course .,Republican
mr. chairman  i do not want to extend this conversation for too much longer .,Republican
i think it is an amendment that we can accept .,Republican
i think it is the amendment that takes out $ 1 million and puts $ 1 million back in .,Republican
i am very happy with that .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from indiana .,Republican
mr. chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Republican
i do so in order to have a very brief discussion with the gentleman who is chairman of the authorizing committee .,Republican
i think many of you in the house know that i spent a lot of years in my life making an honest living in the life and health insurance business so i know a little bit about this subject .,Republican
the gentleman is raising a number of questions that are very legitimate questions .,Republican
i do not think there is a conflict here .,Republican
i just wanted the gentleman to know that it is my intention to examine these serious questions between now and the time we go to conference .,Republican
i am absolutely certain we can at least clear the air on any remaining problems between now and then .,Republican
reclaiming my time  let us not describe what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 did .,Republican
we will be here for hours .,Republican
either we do this my way or we do not .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from indiana .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from indiana .,Republican
reclaiming my time  the gentleman can then  in this complex field  understand when he used the term `` restrict '' that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 might be a bit disconcerted .,Republican
does the gentleman see what i am saying ?,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from wisconsin .,Republican
reclaiming my time  it would be my intention for us to have serious discussions including the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 and his staff and our people so that we know that the air is cleared .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent that the remainder of title i be considered as read  printed in the record  and open to amendment at any point .,Republican
mr. chairman  i withdraw my point of order so we can accept the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman 's amendment .,Republican
i have asked for a ruling of the chair .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
i will not even take all that time .,Republican
i simply want to repeat the arguments against this amendment .,Republican
there are no funds in this bill that go to saudi arabia .,Republican
there is a prohibition in the fiscal year 2005 foreign operations bill that prohibits any funds from going to saudi arabia  and that prohibition applies to this bill .,Republican
this amendment is totally unnecessary .,Republican
this amendment has absolutely no bearing .,Republican
it is simply repeating what is already in the existing law that applies to this bill .,Republican
to add another prohibition here now is simply to add insult to injury .,Republican
it is gratuitous .,Republican
it has absolutely no reason to be in this bill  and i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  reluctantly i make a point of order against the amendment because it is in violation of section 302 ( f ) of the congressional budget act of 1974 .,Republican
the committee on appropriations filed a suballocation on budget totals for fiscal year 2005 on july 22  2004 .,Republican
the amendment would provide new budget authority in excess of the committee allocations and is not permitted under section 302 ( f ) of the act .,Republican
i ask for the ruling of the chair .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would simply say it is our intention to pursue the questions the gentlewoman is asking .,Republican
it may very well be in conference on the supplemental that it is appropriate  but frankly in some ways we take from peter to pay paul .,Republican
we can pursue this is regular order  and i prefer to use the supplemental process for those emergencies that we can not deal with in regular order .,Republican
because of that  i am not pursuing the recommendations at this time .,Republican
we will follow through  however  on the questions that the gentlewoman is asking .,Republican
mr. chairman  i insist on my point of order .,Republican
mr. chairman  in that event  i withdraw my point of order .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order against the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 20 minutes  to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself  the opponent .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
wolf ) xz4004350 .,Republican
madam chairman  speaking further on the point of order  i would simply  calmly say to the gentleman that i very much agree  as the entire house agrees  that we must be responsive to the medical needs of our veterans  especially those who are coming back at this very moment .,Republican
there is not any doubt that the new military quality of life and veterans affairs  and related agencies subcommittee is designed in the fashion to be very responsive to the needs of veterans .,Republican
i urge the gentleman to recognize that we have begun hearings in connection with that already .,Republican
it is our intention in regular order to move these bills very quickly  and there is absolutely no doubt that the needs of these veterans  beyond money that is already in the pipeline  will be met as a result of regular order .,Republican
madam chairman  i am very empathetic to the concerns of the gentleman from california .,Republican
we expect fully to address those concerns in regular order .,Republican
therefore  i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi .,Republican
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.,Republican
'' the amendment includes an emergency designation and as such constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule xxi .,Republican
i ask for a ruling from the chair .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am sure all members are very concerned about the proposed embassy compound in iraq and the number of dollars that are involved .,Republican
i think it is very important that i share with members our discussion with the secretary of state .,Republican
she feels it is absolutely critical that we move forward very quickly with this money  first and foremost because we have almost 4  000 american personnel whose lives are in jeopardy under current conditions .,Republican
indeed  if this compound goes forward quickly  their security will be assured .,Republican
the secretary has been given great assurance that the compound can be completed in 24 months .,Republican
there is only one small hook  and that is in order to get a contractor to bid on such a job in this territory  the money has to be there in the pot .,Republican
so within this bill we are providing the funds to make sure the funds are available and we can move quickly .,Republican
this embassy and the compound are designed to solidify our mission  allowing us to be successful in iraq as well as the middle east .,Republican
it is very important that we go forward with this money now .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i move that the committee do now rise .,Republican
the motion was agreed to .,Republican
accordingly  the committee rose ; and the speaker pro tempore ( mr.,Republican
pearce ) xz4003130 having assumed the chair  mr.,Republican
gilchrest  acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union  reported that that committee  having had under consideration the bill ( h.r.,Republican
1268 ) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30  2005  and for other purposes  had come to no resolution thereon .,Republican
mr. chairman  i withdraw my point of order .,Republican
mr. chairman  while i am very empathetic to the gentleman 's concern  for i have many a grandchild myself  i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi .,Republican
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.,Republican
'' in this case  the amendment addresses funds in other acts  and so i have to reluctantly ask the chair to rule .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i want to say upfront to the house that it is not my intention to speak on the time i have reserved in opposition to this proposition  so i am asking for a chance for an exchange here with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) .,Republican
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) and i have spent a good deal of time behind closed doors in appropriate security to discuss matters like this  but especially to express our concern that the department of defense communicate regularly with the congress relative to activities that might involve areas that are  indeed  secure .,Republican
i have never told the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) this before  but i will never forget as a mere member of the subcommittee on defense and a member of the intelligence committee discussing a program that was in the black that i knew about because i happened to be in the back room  but a program that the department of defense was not very excited about .,Republican
we ended up advancing some money to have that program go forward .,Republican
i have no idea if we would have been unsuccessful with that effort if they had known how serious we were .,Republican
it is important that we communicate with each other .,Republican
communication is a two-way street not a one-way street .,Republican
so for those listening across the river  it is very important to know that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) is serious about this  and the leadership of the house is serious about it as well .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  the gentleman 's amendment is most intriguing .,Republican
the gentleman is interested in having opportunity for veterans to gain employment .,Republican
i presume they are veterans  whether veterans of world war ii or circumstances in iraq or otherwise .,Republican
i presume that is the case .,Republican
i certainly would be supportive of ensuring every veteran has an opportunity to find work  wherever the veteran might have served .,Republican
i would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman .,Republican
yesterday we had a discussion on the floor of the house relative to the gentleman 's wanting to ensure there were additional funding flows for veterans .,Republican
there was some resistance to that suggestion because some of us thought there was money in the pipeline that adequately serviced the hospitals ; and in regular order we would make sure whatever was necessary would be available  at future hearings and markups of bills that affect funding .,Republican
so i want to ask a question : there is a veterans hospital in san diego county  is there not ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i am trying to remember  what is the name of that hospital .,Republican
i am trying to remember .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman 's amendment .,Republican
san diego veterans medical center in la jolla .,Republican
and does it happen to be in the gentleman 's district ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i appreciate the remarks of my colleague from illinois .,Republican
i would suggest that in voting for this amendment  members would be voting against the view of our commander in chief  the president of the united states .,Republican
the secretary of state has spoken very strongly about the urgency of this matter .,Republican
there is little doubt that we have the appropriate place  we have the plans in place  we can get it done quickly .,Republican
we need the money up front .,Republican
that is why it is here .,Republican
because of that  mr.,Republican
chairman  i urge a `` no '' vote on the upton amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment .,Republican
the gentlewoman has raised some very important points  and i know she has done a great deal of work in this area as it relates to charles taylor and west africa .,Republican
there is no question it is a very troubled area  and charles taylor has certainly contributed to the instability in the region .,Republican
there are no funds in the legislation that deal with nigeria  and there are a lot of circumstances around this issue that i think are difficult in the sense that the united states has played a role in all of this as to where he is at the moment .,Republican
we do want this person brought to justice  and i know that is the intention of the united states .,Republican
i would hope  however  that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment because i believe that would be in the best interest of united states foreign policy .,Republican
we will certainly work with the gentlewoman and her staff to try to resolve the situation  and work with the state department and the gentlewoman to get a satisfactory explanation of what is being done .,Republican
and was the gentleman involved in that ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i would ask the gentleman  did we successfully get money for that seismic retrofitting ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i wish the gentleman would have discussed that with me at the time .,Republican
we had a similar problem at loma linda veterans medical center  the sister hospital of the jerry pettis veterans hospital  and we found a way to do seismic retrofitting by way of using a laser .,Republican
no portion of the hospital needs to be closed down while the work is being done .,Republican
thereby  patients can actually be in the hospital while the work is being done .,Republican
we did not have that discussion .,Republican
mr. chairman  has the gentleman visited that hospital in the last years ?,Republican
in the last year ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i attempt to visit my hospital regularly as well .,Republican
and  indeed  visit the veterans who are now back at walter reed or bethesda .,Republican
indeed  we all should be concerned about that priority .,Republican
but  frankly  i am a bit incensed by the gentleman 's suggestion yesterday that would indicate that we do not give priority on a bipartisan basis to veterans .,Republican
i would ask the gentleman to join me in a special mission .,Republican
would the gentleman consider the mission ?,Republican
mr. chairman  the mission is the veterans service organizations are a great voice for veterans here in washington .,Republican
like the gentleman  they are constantly pounding their chest saying  i am calling for money  more opportunity for veterans .,Republican
i insist that they help us go back to where the hospitals are and see that veterans are treated like real human beings in those hospitals .,Republican
i can not get the vsos to do it .,Republican
maybe i can get the gentleman to do it because the gentleman is obviously more concerned than the vsos are about those veterans benefits and the way they are being treated .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask  would the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
filner ) xz4001330 join me in that effort  or does the gentleman believe the money is being spent very well at veterans hospitals ?,Republican
who says we do not have enough money ?,Republican
... ..,Republican
how much time do i have remaining  mr.,Republican
chairman ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i reclaim my time .,Republican
... ..,Republican
let me say that we made a major effort to see that veterans in our hospital did not have to walk around with folders under their arm .,Republican
we insisted on computerization within that hospital .,Republican
the gentleman could help me a lot helping the vsos to really work with veterans where they are being treated or not treated so well .,Republican
mr. chairman  i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill which violates clause 2 rule xxi .,Republican
the rule states that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law or imposes additional duties .,Republican
i ask for the chair 's ruling .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Republican
i appreciate the gentlewoman from new york yielding .,Republican
como esta .,Republican
i wanted to say to the gentlewoman  first  i very much appreciate the thrust of her amendment .,Republican
while we are prepared to accept her amendment  let me add to that there could be some resistance  perhaps  on the part of the state department .,Republican
if there is resistance  it is because they have never seen fit to apply the existing law to overseas contracts .,Republican
i think that is a small mistake on their part  frankly  if they have not .,Republican
i think the gentlewoman is not just raising an important point but a point that needed to be made .,Republican
let me say to the gentlewoman that her amendment is overdue .,Republican
i am happy to accept it and i am happy to be her partner on behalf of small business in america .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit largely because i believe on both sides of the aisle the body recognizes that the reason for this supplemental is to provide as quickly as possible money flows in support of our troops .,Republican
this is a supplemental dealing with our challenges in the middle east especially .,Republican
it is a supplemental dealing with the crises that have resulted from the tsunami .,Republican
but  in the meantime  the gentlewoman is suggesting that we should recommit this bill to add $ 150 million .,Republican
the best thing that we can do for our troops is to move this bill very quickly and send it on its way for a conference with the senate .,Republican
there is absolutely no question that to have a recommittal motion be successful that would add $ 150 million to an $ 82 billion package  the vast percentage of which is in support of our troops  at best is a technical exercise .,Republican
to recommit for the sake of recommitting is not a reflection of how seriously we are taking the challenge we have of supporting our troops .,Republican
so i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit  and i urge members on both sides of the aisle to recognize that we must move forward with this supplemental .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise to claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i am pleased to bring to the house for its consideration the conference report on h.r.,Republican
1268  the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense  the global war on terror and tsunami relief .,Republican
the conference agreement includes a total of $ 82 billion .,Republican
the vast majority of these funds are to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan .,Republican
for that reason  it is critical that we move this package quickly .,Republican
it also provides needed assistance to the victims of the tsunami .,Republican
during our conference with the senate  chairman cochran and i agreed that the final agreement should come in at or below the president 's request and relatively free of extraneous items .,Republican
the conference report before you has met both of these very critical parameters .,Republican
we did our very best to keep the package clean  and by and large  we were successful with that .,Republican
we have funded our foreign policy priorities while still preserving congressional prerogatives where appropriate .,Republican
with that said  the conference report provides a total of $ 75.9 billion for defense-related expenditures  roughly $ 921 million over the president 's request .,Republican
the additions over the request are for force protection  and increasing the survivability of troops in the field .,Republican
in addition to the defense-related spending  the conference report provides a reduction of $ 1.5 billion in foreign assistance from the president 's request .,Republican
the conference agreement also includes $ 635 million for increased border security enforcement .,Republican
this includes 500 additional border patrol agents and increased detention space .,Republican
we have also included $ 656 million for tsunami disaster relief .,Republican
finally  the bill includes much of the real id act of 2005  which was included in the house-passed version of the bill .,Republican
the provisions on asylum  border infrastructure  and driver 's license standards are included .,Republican
each of these provisions will greatly enhance the security of our borders .,Republican
all of these provisions reflect agreements negotiated by relevant authorizing committees .,Republican
i especially want to thank chairman sensenbrenner  chairman davis and their staffs for getting this measure before the congress in a timely fashion .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this much needed support for our troops .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for one of the most illuminating  but also one of the longest  statements i have ever heard him make on the floor .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to our majority whip  the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
blunt ) xz4000340 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the subcommittee on science  state  justice  and commerce  and related agencies  the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
wolf ) xz4004350 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the subcommittee on homeland security  the gentleman from kentucky ( mr.,Republican
rogers ) xz4003401 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
kolbe ) xz4002260  my colleague on the committee .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am proud to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910  a great member of our committee .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 as i express my deep appreciation for his cooperation in this project .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from maryland ( mr.,Republican
gilchrest ) xz4001490 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
renzi ) xz4003360 .,Republican
mr. speaker  pursuant to house resolution 258  i call up the conference report on the bill ( h.r.,Republican
1268 ) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30  2005  to establish and rapidly implement regulations for state driver 's license and identification document security standards  to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the united states  to unify terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and removal  to ensure expeditious construction of the san diego border fence  and for other purposes .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois ( mr.,Republican
lahood ) xz4002280 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  let me begin by saying that while i very strongly oppose my colleague from wisconsin 's motion to recommit  the gentleman was kind enough to share the recommittal motion with us before the fact  and i am very much appreciative of that .,Republican
the greatest difficulty i have with the motion is that at this moment our forces are on gas fumes  rather than real gasoline .,Republican
it is very  very critical that we get this bill moving towards the president 's desk and to the troops as quickly as possible .,Republican
i would like to speak for a moment about some of those things that the bill does that may be of great interest to the members who are concerned especially about border security .,Republican
within this package there are some 500 border patrol agents  added as a result of this measure as it goes to the president 's desk .,Republican
there are 218 immigration enforcement agents and criminal investigators .,Republican
there are some 1  950 detention beds .,Republican
the bill is designed to take every step that we possibly can on short order to secure our border .,Republican
at the same time  just yesterday the subcommittee on homeland security marked up their 2006 bill to move further down this same pathway .,Republican
we are moving very quickly to strengthen and secure our borders by way of this legislation  as well as regular order .,Republican
from there  mr.,Republican
speaker  let me express my deepest appreciation to members on both sides of the aisle who have worked very hard  their staffs  as well as the members themselves  to make sure that this supplemental would arrive on time and ahead of schedule .,Republican
virtually nobody thought we would be here at this moment .,Republican
the reason we are is because the members recognize how critical it is that we get this support to our troops immediately .,Republican
mr. speaker  i very much appreciate my colleagues ' patience as we work quickly on this bill .,Republican
it is a very good bill .,Republican
i urge my colleagues ' support .,Republican
mr. speaker  i recently presented a joint statement with senator snowe regarding small business contracting and would like to submit it for the record .,Republican
section 6022 of h.r.,Republican
1268  as adopted in the conference report  h. rep .,Republican
109-72  contains certain provisions concerning small business contracting at the department of energy .,Republican
these provisions were inserted as a substitute for section 6023 of the senate version of h.r.,Republican
1268 .,Republican
section 6023  among other things sought to amend the small business act to authorize counting of small business subcontracts at the department of energy 's large prime contractors for purposes of reporting small business prime contracting results .,Republican
because the substitute language was not adopted by congress through regular legislative proceedings in the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship and the house committee on small business but was adopted anew during the house-senate conference  the in subsections 6022 ( a ) and ( b )  the language chosen to replace section 6023 in the conference report directs the department of energy and the small business administration to enter into a memorandum of understanding for reporting small business prime contracts and subcontracts at the department of energy .,Republican
this replacement language does not change the small business act 's clear distinction between prime contracts and subcontracts  does not amend the statutory small business prime contracting goal requirements which are binding on the department of energy  and does not obviate congressional and regulatory policies against contract bundling .,Republican
this language does not repeal the president 's executive order 13360 directing the department of energy to comply with its separate statutory prime contracting and subcontracting goals for awards to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans .,Republican
any interpretation to the contrary would be unreasonable and contrary to congressional intent .,Republican
in subsection 6022 ( c )  the replacement language mandates a study of changes to management prime contracts at the department of energy to encourage small business prime contracting opportunities .,Republican
the object of the study is to examine the feasibility of establishing a procurement agency relationship between the management prime contractors and the department of energy in accordance with the requirements of federal procurement laws  federal procurement regulations  the `` federal norm '' of government contracting as recognized by the comptroller general  and applicable judicial precedent such as u.s. west communications  inc .,Republican
v. united states  940 f.2d 622 ( fed .,Republican
cir .,Republican
1991 ) .,Republican
finally  in subsection 6022 ( d )  the replacement language imposes certain requirements upon the department of energy concerning break-outs of services from large prime contracts for awards to small businesses .,Republican
first  the secretary of energy is required to consider whether services performed have been previously provided by a small business concern .,Republican
this requirement is for acquisition planning purposes only  and shall not be construed as imposing a restriction of any kind on the ability of the department of energy to break out its large prime contracts for award to small businesses .,Republican
congress recognizes that most of work currently contracted by the department of energy to its large prime contractors has never been historically performed by small businesses .,Republican
however  this does not waive the application of the small business act  the president 's executive order 13360  or the president 's initiative against contract bundling to the department of energy .,Republican
second  the secretary of energy is required,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong opposition to h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
this bill purports to make us safer from terrorists who may sneak into the united states  and from other illegal immigrants .,Republican
while i agree that these issues are of vital importance  this bill will do very little to make us more secure .,Republican
it will not address our real vulnerabilities .,Republican
it will  however  make us much less free .,Republican
in reality  this bill is a trojan horse .,Republican
it pretends to offer desperately needed border control in order to stampede americans into sacrificing what is uniquely american : our constitutionally protected liberty .,Republican
what is wrong with this bill ?,Republican
the real id act establishes a national id card by mandating that states include certain minimum identification standards on driver 's licenses .,Republican
it contains no limits on the government 's power to impose additional standards .,Republican
indeed  it gives authority to the secretary of homeland security to unilaterally add requirements as he sees fit .,Republican
supporters claim it is not a national id because it is voluntary .,Republican
however  any state that opts out will automatically make non-persons out of its citizens .,Republican
the citizens of that state will be unable to have any dealings with the federal government because their id will not be accepted .,Republican
they will not be able to fly or to take a train .,Republican
in essence  in the eyes of the federal government they will cease to exist .,Republican
it is absurd to call this voluntary .,Republican
republican party talking points on this bill  which claim that this is not a national id card  nevertheless endorse the idea that `` the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses.,Republican
'' so they admit that they want a national id but at the same time pretend that this is not a national id .,Republican
this bill establishes a massive  centrally coordinated database of highly personal information about american citizens : at a minimum their name  date of birth  place of residence  social security number  and physical and possibly other characteristics .,Republican
what is even more disturbing is that  by mandating that states participate in the drivers license agreement  this bill creates a massive database of sensitive information on american citizens that will be shared with canada and mexico .,Republican
this bill could have a chilling effect on the exercise of our constitutionally guaranteed rights .,Republican
it re-defines `` terrorism '' in broad new terms that could well include members of firearms rights and anti-abortion groups  or other such groups as determined by whoever is in power at the time .,Republican
there are no prohibitions against including such information in the database as information about a person 's exercise of first amendment rights or about a person 's appearance on a registry of firearms owners .,Republican
this legislation gives authority to the secretary of homeland security to expand required information on driver 's licenses  potentially including such biometric information as retina scans  fingerprints  dna information  and even radio frequency identification  rfid  radio tracking technology .,Republican
including such technology as rfid would mean that the federal government  as well as the governments of canada and mexico  would know where americans are at all time of the day and night .,Republican
there are no limits on what happens to the database of sensitive information on americans once it leaves the united states for canada and mexico -- or perhaps other countries .,Republican
who is to stop a corrupt foreign government official from selling or giving this information to human traffickers or even terrorists ?,Republican
will this uncertainty make us feel safer ?,Republican
what will all of this mean for us ?,Republican
when this new program is implemented  every time we are required to show our driver 's license we will  in fact  be showing a national identification card .,Republican
we will be handing over a card that includes our personal and likely biometric information  information which is connected to a national and international database .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 does nothing to solve the growing threat to national security posed by people who are already in the u.s. illegally .,Republican
instead  h.r.,Republican
418 states what we already know : that certain people here illegally are `` deportable.,Republican
'' but it does nothing to mandate deportation .,Republican
although congress funded an additional 2  000 border guards last year  the administration has announced that it will only ask for an additional 210 guards .,Republican
why are we not pursuing these avenues as a way of safeguarding our country ?,Republican
why are we punishing americans by taking away their freedoms instead of making life more difficult for those who would enter our country illegally ?,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 does what legislation restricting firearm ownership does .,Republican
it punishes law abiding citizens .,Republican
criminals will ignore it .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 offers us a false sense of greater security at the cost of taking a gigantic step toward making america a police state .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from virginia for yielding me this time  and i rise today in very  very strong support of the identification reforms that are in this legislation .,Republican
these reforms  in my opinion  are extremely necessary to help us better protect our identity documents and to secure our borders .,Republican
this legislation will help america to better protect our nation from those who wish to do us harm .,Republican
no longer will we allow terrorists free access to state-issued identity documents as a way to use the tools of our freedom against us .,Republican
no longer will we stand idly by and watch terrorists harm our homeland .,Republican
state-issued driver 's licenses and state identification cards are the most widely used form of identification in the nation .,Republican
it is the backbone  quite frankly  of our identity .,Republican
it provides legitimacy to any person who holds this form of identification .,Republican
driver 's licenses are used in everyday instances  such as boarding an airplane or enrolling in a flight school .,Republican
does that sound familiar ?,Republican
well  it should .,Republican
because according to the 9/11 commission report  all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of u.s. identification documents  some by fraud .,Republican
all but one of the hijackers used a state-issued driver 's license on that horrific day .,Republican
even more frightening is the fact that a regular driver 's license is your passport to obtain a commercial driver 's license  from which then  of course  you can then try to obtain a hazardous materials license  an endorsement on your commercial driver 's license .,Republican
it is bad enough to think about giving terrorists access to our roadways and our aircraft  but it is unthinkable to give them access to 40  000 gallons of liquid propane  as an example .,Republican
this legislation also closes a loophole which has allowed illegal aliens to get access to our driver 's licenses .,Republican
our message on this issue is clear : if you are not in this country legally  then you will not be given legal sanctions on our roads .,Republican
if you are in america on a visa  you will be issued a driver 's license ; but it will expire on the same day as your visa .,Republican
muhammed atta  as has been said  came to america on a 6-month visa  but he was issued a 6-year florida driver 's license .,Republican
i struggled with this issue  as the chairman had said .,Republican
in my former role as the secretary of state in michigan  where i served as the chief motor vehicle administrator  i was forced to issue drivers ' licenses to illegal aliens .,Republican
unfortunately  michigan is one of the states that continues this practice .,Republican
it has become a state of choice for illegals to obtain a license .,Republican
we must stop this practice .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  we are all grateful to our troops and those serving in iraq .,Republican
we are grateful for what we are seeing happening there  and we want to do what we can to support those efforts and make sure that our troops have what they need .,Republican
but every time when i go home  no matter what the subject is that we are talking about in any meeting  the thing that always comes up is the deficit .,Republican
somebody always says  `` but what are you doing about the deficit ?,Republican
`` my concern with the embassy being in the supplemental is exactly that  it is over and above the regular process .,Republican
i have no problem with building an embassy in iraq .,Republican
we need an embassy in iraq  but we have also known we need an embassy in iraq  and why did it not come through earlier if it is that much of an emergency .,Republican
yes  it is a huge amount of money and i understand it is not just a building  it is a compound  but it is three times what we have spent in afghanistan already .,Republican
if we do not start getting some discipline in this body in what we are doing  we are never going to get back to where we all want to be  and that is what we did in 1997 was start to balance the budget  and we were well on the way .,Republican
sure  we have had a lot of problems .,Republican
we had the war  the recession  other problems which have interfered with that  but we have to have some fiscal discipline and just putting things that are not actual emergencies in a supplemental spending bill in my opinion is not to be done .,Republican
a supplemental is for emergencies and i do not consider an embassy to be an emergency .,Republican
my constituents at home agree with this .,Republican
as i said before  whenever i am anywhere they always say what are you doing about cutting spending  what are you doing about the deficit ?,Republican
i hope we can bring this embassy back through regular order and make it happen because we want to be sure the people are protected  and then pass the supplemental today .,Republican
the other things in the supplemental are needed .,Republican
there is no question about that .,Republican
our chairman has done a very  very good job with this bill  but i have a problem with funding the embassy in a supplemental .,Republican
madam chairman  i move to strike the last word .,Republican
madam chairman  i wish to extend my gratitude on behalf of the entire florida delegation to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) and the gentleman from kentucky ( mr.,Republican
mike rogers ) for entering into this colloquy with us regarding a very crucial issue to florida as well as this congress .,Republican
last fall the state of florida withstood an historic four hurricanes causing enormous devastation and damage to property  waterways  homes and individuals ' lives .,Republican
i commend the relief efforts on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane as well as the willingness of congress to step forward and offer meaningful relief to hurricane victims .,Republican
but there are two issues for which the department of homeland security  federal emergency management agency should recognize under their current statutory authority to effectively address florida hurricane-related damage .,Republican
congress appropriated funds to respond to the hurricane devastation through the military construction appropriations and emergency hurricane supplemental appropriations act 2005  public law 108-324  and the emergency supplemental of 2004  public law 108-303 .,Republican
mr. chairman  during the debate of the real id act of 2005  of which i am a co-sponsor  i was unavoidably detained and unfortunately missed the opportunity to vote on the amendment offered by representative jerrold nadler .,Republican
if i would have been present  i would have voted a resounding `` no '' against this amendment .,Republican
the nadler amendment would have stricken the provision in the real id act that tightens and improves our asylum system  which has been abused by terrorists with deadly consequences .,Republican
the real id act will protect the american people by allowing immigration judges to determine witness credibility in asylum cases and ensuring that all terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility are also grounds for deportation .,Republican
in summary  as a co-sponsor of this bill  i believe that all of the provisions in the real id act are essential in protecting our citizens from future terrorist plots and i would have voted `` no '' on the nadler amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
hayworth ) xz4001730 .,Republican
mr. chairman  due to a previously scheduled commitment away from capitol hill  i was unavoidably detained and regretfully missed rollcall vote no .,Republican
75  the markey amendment .,Republican
had i been present  i would have voted `` aye .,Republican
'',Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the real id act and with a particular sense of gratitude toward the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner )  who has doggedly brought this legislation to the hill for one reason and one reason only .,Republican
9/11 is not theoretical for me .,Republican
i was here .,Republican
i was on the capitol grounds  and my family during the school year lives in the washington d.c.  area  and like millions of other families in new york and washington  d.c.  was imperiled .,Republican
as the 9/11 commission report stated  `` for terrorists  travel documents are as important as weapons.,Republican
'' on page 390 of the report they point out that `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of u.s. identification by fraud and that acquisition of these forms of identification assisted them in boarding commercial flights.,Republican
'' by bringing this legislation today  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) is making my family safer in this post-9/11 america  and also closing asylum loopholes  strengthening our deportation laws .,Republican
it is time for congress to get real and pass the real id act and make our families and our nation safer .,Republican
mr. chairman  it is my understanding that hospital needs a lot of work .,Republican
i assume the gentleman suggests that veterans ought to be first in line if we do some refurbishing ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the rule .,Republican
i rise also in support of the sessions amendment .,Republican
but i also would like to take this time to make a few comments about why i will be voting against the bill .,Republican
with the utmost sincerity and a deep conviction  i am quite confident that this bill  if you vote for it  you will be voting for a national id card .,Republican
i know some will argue against that and they say this is voluntary  but it really can not be voluntary .,Republican
if a state opts out  nobody is going to accept their driver 's license .,Republican
so this is not voluntary .,Republican
as a matter of fact  even the house republican conference  which sent a statement around with some points about this bill  said `` the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses.,Republican
'' this is nationalization of all identification .,Republican
it will be the confirmation of the notion that we will be carrying our papers .,Republican
as a matter of fact  i think it might be worse than just carrying our papers and showing our papers  because in this bill there are no limitations as to the information that may be placed on this identification card .,Republican
there are minimum standards  but no maximum limitations .,Republican
the secretary of the department of homeland security can add anything it wants .,Republican
so if they would like to put on our driver 's license that you belong to a pro-gun group  it may well become mandatory  because there may be an administration some day that might like to have that information .,Republican
but there is no limitation as far as biometrics and there is no limitation as far as radio frequency identification .,Republican
that technology is already available and being used on our passports .,Republican
this means that you do not have to show your papers .,Republican
all you have to do is walk by somebody that has a radio frequency ability to read your passport or read your driver 's license .,Republican
there is no limitation as to what they can put on these documents .,Republican
this bill also allows the definition of `` terrorism '' to be re-defined .,Republican
there are no limitations .,Republican
in many ways i understand how well intentioned this is  but to me it is sort of like the gun issue .,Republican
conservatives always know that you do not register guns  that is just terrible  because the criminals will not register their guns .,Republican
but what are we doing with this bill ?,Republican
we are registering all the american people  and your goal is to register the criminals and the thugs and the terrorists .,Republican
well  why does a terrorist need a driver 's license ?,Republican
they can just steal a car or steal an airplane or steal a bus or whatever they want to do .,Republican
so you are registering all the american people because you are looking for a terrorist  and all the terrorist is going to do is avoid the law .,Republican
but we all  the american people  will have to obey the law .,Republican
if we do not  we go to prison .,Republican
so i rise in strong objection to this bill .,Republican
i hope there will be a few that will oppose h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from kentucky .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to this $ 82 billion `` emergency '' supplemental bill .,Republican
i also am opposed to the manner in which the real id act  h.r.,Republican
418  was attached to the rule  thereby stealthily making the establishment of a national id part of an `` emergency '' bill to which it is completely unrelated .,Republican
once again we see controversial bills being hidden inside another bill so that they are automatically passed where they otherwise might face opposition .,Republican
i do not believe this is a wise practice .,Republican
this `` emergency '' supplemental is the second largest supplemental appropriations bill in united states history  second only to the one last year .,Republican
the funds will be considered `` emergency '' funds so congress can ignore spending caps that would require the billions in new spending to be offset by reducing spending elsewhere .,Republican
we are told that this is emergency spending  and that we therefore must not question this enormous expenditure .,Republican
does an emergency require sending billions of american taxpayers ' dollars overseas as foreign aid an emergency ?,Republican
this bill is filled with foreign aid spending .,Republican
if we pass this ill-conceived legislation  we will spend $ 656 million for tsunami relief ; $ 94 million for darfur  sudan ; $ 150 million for food aid  most to liberia and sudan ; $ 580 million for `` peacekeeping '' overseas ; $ 582 million to build a new american embassy in iraq ; $ 76 million to build a new airport in kuwait ( one of the wealthiest countries on earth ) ; $ 257 million for counter drug efforts in afghanistan ; $ 372 million for health  reconstruction  and alternative development programs to help farmers stop raising poppy ; $ 200 million in economic aid for the palestinians ; $ 150 million for pakistan ( run by an unelected dictator ) ; $ 200 million for jordan ; $ 34 million for ukraine .,Republican
does anyone really believe that all this foreign aid is `` emergency '' spending ?,Republican
or is it just an opportunity for some off-budget spending ?,Republican
just the above foreign aid equals almost $ 3.5 billion .,Republican
does anyone believe that sending this much money abroad as international welfare is a good thing for our economy ?,Republican
is there a baseball emergency ?,Republican
there must be  because this `` emergency '' supplemental contains a provision to allow washington  d.c .,Republican
to use taxpayer money to build a baseball stadium .,Republican
mr. chairman  this bill is almost unimaginably expensive .,Republican
it is our out-of-control spending that really is the greatest threat to the united states and our way of life .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to reject this legislation .,Republican
i thank the chairman for his time and attention to this most important effort .,Republican
it is my hope that this colloquy brings clarity and direction to fema as it administers the critical disaster relief funds .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank chairman lewis for including in the supplemental the provision which is our wounded warrior bill .,Republican
as our enemies adapt their war-fighting strategies  they change not just to kill our men and women overseas  but to maim and wound .,Republican
roadside incendiary devices  rocket grenades  car bombs mean the loss of several arms and legs and eyes  blindness and paralysis .,Republican
our men and woman coming home at walter reed army hospital and their families coming up to be with them so they can heal faster are incurring great debt .,Republican
never mind that they try to transition back into society  those great wage earners  trying to find self-worth in the work .,Republican
this bill includes the wounded warrior project .,Republican
it says to our troops  we are going to provide you with supplemental disability insurance to help you transition back to being american citizens and thank you for your patriotism .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote for this supplemental .,Republican
do not allow these traumatic injuries to be the economic death sentence after our troops have survived the death bed overseas .,Republican
vote for our wounded warriors .,Republican
madam chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
i want to compliment the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and the other conferees for giving us a whole new effort  a major effort to try to control the borders and to deal with the massive illegal immigration problem that the country is facing .,Republican
we have 11 million estimated illegal aliens in the country  and 800  000 or so of them are people who have been ordered deported and yet have absconded .,Republican
eighty thousand of those have criminal records .,Republican
this bill  when combined with the homeland security appropriations bills for 2006 that we marked up yesterday in the subcommittee  those two bills combined will give us a new  massive effort to deal with the problem .,Republican
these two bills will give us 1  500 new border patrol agents  568 new immigration and customs enforcement officers throughout the country  and some 3  900 new jail bed space to try to deal with this massive  overwhelming problem .,Republican
i want to commend the chairman for having the foresight  along with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 and the other members of the conference  for giving us the new capability to tackle a problem that is proving to be very elusive .,Republican
so i compliment the chairman  and i urge everyone to support this bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of this rule to provide for consideration of this counterterrorism bill of which i am an original cosponsor .,Republican
this is the real id act .,Republican
it closes  among other things  the 3-mile hole in the fortified u.s.-mexico border fence near san diego .,Republican
border security must be a pillar of our national security policy .,Republican
recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with alien smuggling rings like ms-13 in order to enter the united states  particularly through our porous southern border .,Republican
this bill establishes strong security standards for the issuance of driver 's licenses that all states must comply with to eliminate weak links in identity security .,Republican
the nineteen 9/11 hijackers had 63 validly issued driver 's licenses and other forms of identification between them  and they were using these ids to move around the country undetected  plotting and planning .,Republican
in fact  eight of them were even registered to vote .,Republican
they then used the bogus licenses that they had to board u.s. planes .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 cracks down on asylum fraud by ensuring all terrorism-related grounds of inadmissibility are grounds for deportation .,Republican
the blind sheik  omar abdel rahman  who led a plot to bomb new york city landmarks  used an asylum application to avoid his deportation .,Republican
it is a fact that terrorists have continued to use and abuse asylum laws to stay in our country .,Republican
as the 9/11 commission found  abusing our asylum law is `` the primary method  '' in their words  used by terrorist aliens  like the 1993 world trade center bombers ramzi yousef and ahmad ajaj  to remain in the united states .,Republican
both  in the words of the 9/11 commission  `` concocted bogus political asylum stories when they arrived in the united states.,Republican
'' so if we want to make it harder for terrorists like yousef and ajaj to abuse our asylum system  support this counterterrorism bill .,Republican
the ninth circuit created an extremely disturbing precedent that has made it easier for suspected terrorists to receive asylum .,Republican
the circuit has held that if a foreign government harasses an alien because he has been affiliated with a terrorist group  the alien is eligible for asylum because he could be persecuted on account of the political opinion of that terrorist group .,Republican
since members of terrorist organizations are eligible to receive asylum  under this doctrine an alien could receive asylum expressly because he was an admitted member of a terrorist organization .,Republican
the bill returns the law to its original understanding and overturns this ninth circuit precedent by requiring that asylum applicants establish that race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion was or will be a central reason for their claimed persecution .,Republican
these are commonsense changes to national security and to border security .,Republican
madam chairman  house report 108-773 which accompanied the military construction emergency hurricane supplemental bill stated  `` the conferees agree to provide an additional $ 6.5 billion for disaster relief activities associated with declared disasters such as hurricanes frances  ivan and jeanne.,Republican
'' supplemental funds appropriated in the wake of the four hurricanes may be used by fema in administering relief to stricken communities and victims in areas such as florida where the president declared disaster areas that meet current statutory eligibility under the stafford act .,Republican
madam chairman  it is my understanding that the stafford act authorizes the removal of wreckage and debris resulting from a major disaster from both public and private lands when the president determines that it is in the public interest .,Republican
mr. chairman  on september 11  we were attacked by terrorists who took advantage of weaknesses in our border security .,Republican
after infiltrating our country  the terrorists were able to conceal their real identities  and thereby plot their attacks without fear of being apprehended .,Republican
if we  as a congress  want to seriously address the problem of terrorism  then we must address the issue of border security .,Republican
for this reason  i rise to express my support for the real id act .,Republican
this bill contains urgent border security reforms that were not addressed in the intelligence reform bill that president bush signed into law in december .,Republican
foremost in this bill are provisions that would prevent terrorists from obtaining a united states driver 's license .,Republican
without a license  potential terrorists will have a much harder time opening a bank account  traveling  and conducting other business necessary to plot an attack .,Republican
i think we all understand that preserving freedom is not an easy process .,Republican
freedom is a difficult journey filled with enemies who will try to destroy it if they are left unchecked .,Republican
for this reason  i strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the real id act .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am pleased that the conference report includes the real id act  which i co-sponsored .,Republican
and of course the goal of this bill is straightforward .,Republican
it seeks to prevent another terrorist attack on u.s. soil by disrupting terrorist travel .,Republican
these provisions were called for by the 9/11 commission .,Republican
and this legislation uses existing states driver 's license systems to ensure we know who is in our country  that people are who they say they are  and that the name on a driver 's license is the holder 's real name  not an alias .,Republican
all but one of the 9/11 hijackers used u.s. driver 's licenses to board the planes that day because these documents allowed them to circumvent their expired visas .,Republican
it allowed them to not raise suspicion or concern .,Republican
mohammed atta received a 6-month visa to stay in the u.s. he received a florida driver 's license good for 6 years .,Republican
the real id act will end this by establishing a rule for all states  that temporary driver 's licenses for foreign visitors expire when their visa terms expire and establishes tough rules for confirming identity before driver 's licenses are issued .,Republican
mr. chairman  as chairman of the subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation  i have to ask  who should be in charge of counterterrorism policy ?,Republican
should it be the california coastal commission or should it be the department of homeland security ?,Republican
that is the crux of this argument .,Republican
now  environmental groups have successfully fought the completion of this fence over the years  claiming that it would have a serious impact on everything from the san diego fairy shrimp to the san diego button celery  all that in this 3.5 mile strip of desert along the border .,Republican
does anyone think we can secure the border and save the button celery by putting up a fence to stop people from trampling on it ?,Republican
yes  we can .,Republican
can we protect ourselves from al qaeda operatives who have joined forces with alien smuggling rings like ms 13 in order to enter the united states through our porous southern border by stopping them from squishing the fairy shrimp as they slip through the gap in the fence ?,Republican
yes  we can .,Republican
it is a win-win .,Republican
in the interest of national security  we need to defeat this amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
much has been and will be said about this bill 's impact on making it more difficult for terrorists to get identification to conduct their terrorist activities and the reform of the asylum laws and the plugging of the fence south of san diego .,Republican
however  there is an issue of public safety involved in this bill as well .,Republican
yesterday  a criminal complaint was unsealed in the federal court in chicago which showed that there was a huge scam in getting wisconsin driver 's licenses for illegal aliens to drive trucks .,Republican
and in at least one instance  the case of nasko nazov  who is an illegal alien from macedonia  3 days after he obtained this driver 's license  he killed four people  a family of four  in a truck-car accident in baileyton  tennessee .,Republican
now  the criminal complaint says that the scam worked as follows : foreign nationals paid sponsors in chicago up to $ 2  000 for help in getting a commercial driver 's license .,Republican
several wisconsin residents were paid a one-time fee for use of their addresses .,Republican
the clients were transported from chicago to milwaukee via van to banks in milwaukee  where they used the wisconsin addresses to open checking accounts .,Republican
after the checks were printed  the clients brought them to the division of motor vehicles as proof of their residency required to take their written tests .,Republican
in wisconsin  the written tests were given in english  spanish  and russian .,Republican
people who spoke other languages had to bring their own interpreters .,Republican
some of the interpreters helped the clients cheat on the tests .,Republican
in some cases  the sponsors accompanied the clients to a private facility that has a contract with the state to conduct road tests .,Republican
employees there accepted payments that ensured that the clients passed the test whether or not they knew how to drive a truck .,Republican
now  because wisconsin does not require proof of legal residency in the united states in order to get a driver 's license  whether it is a regular license or a commercial driver 's license  mr.,Republican
nazov got a license validly issued by the wisconsin department of motor vehicles  and 3 days later killed a family of four on a highway in tennessee with a truck he did not know how to drive .,Republican
now  legislation like this would have been a key move in preventing an illegal alien from getting this driver 's license  a driver 's license he could not have gotten in the state of illinois .,Republican
i think this proves that there is more involved to this than border security .,Republican
there is an issue of public safety .,Republican
and if you do not believe that  ask the family of the people who were killed in tennessee .,Republican
mr. speaker  i submit for the record the story from the milwaukee journal sentinel entitled `` tennessee deaths bring new charge.,Republican
'' tennessee deaths bring new charge : trucker illegally obtained license here a man who got a commercial truck driver 's license illegally in wisconsin killed a family of four on a tennessee freeway  then lied about his actions  according to a criminal compliant unsealed tuesday in federal court in chicago .,Republican

george ryan .,Republican
the investigation also revealed that in wisconsin at least 600 people from other states cheated on written exams  bribed officials administering road tests or lied about their residency to get truck driver 's licenses  according to court records .,Republican
if convicted  nazov  45  of downers grove  ill.,Republican
 faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison  a fine of up to $ 500  000 and deportation .,Republican
he also is wanted in tennessee on reckless homicide charges  said randall sanborn  spokesman for the u.s. attorney 's office in chicago .,Republican
nazov -- who has never lived in wisconsin -- received a wisconsin commercial driver 's license on march 4  2003  according to court records .,Republican
three days later he caused a fatal wreck on i-81 near baileyton  tenn.,Republican

`` we believe there are up to 1  000 suspect licenses  and this shows the risk inherent in each of those  '' u.s. attorney steve biskupic said tuesday .,Republican
a milwaukee investigation parallel to the one in chicago is continuing  he said .,Republican
both probes center on foreign nationals .,Republican
according to court records in the chicago case  the scheme worked like this : the foreign nationals paid sponsors in the chicago area up to $ 2  000 for help getting a commercial driver 's license .,Republican
several wisconsin residents were paid a one-time fee for use of their addresses .,Republican
clients were transported from chicago via van to banks in milwaukee  where they used the wisconsin addresses to open checking accounts .,Republican
after the checks were printed  the clients brought them to the division of motor vehicles as the proof of residency required to take their written tests .,Republican
in wisconsin  the written tests are given in english  spanish or russian .,Republican
people who speak other languages must bring their own interpreters .,Republican
some of the interpreters helped the clients cheat on the tests .,Republican
in some cases  the sponsors accompanied the clients to a private facility that has a contract with the state to conduct road tests .,Republican
employees there accepted payments that ensured the clients passed their tests  whether or not they knew how to drive a truck .,Republican
the wisconsin rules for licensing are less strict than those in illinois .,Republican
there  written tests are offered only in english  and translators are not allowed .,Republican
road tests in illinois must be conducted at state offices  not private facilities .,Republican
nazov listed an address in the 4200 block of w. loomis road in greenfield on his driver 's license application  according to the charging documents .,Republican

mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  in december  the president signed into law legislation intended to respond to the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Republican
unfortunately  the legislation that was enacted failed to include several key provisions critical to addressing vulnerabilities found in both the 9/11 commission report and of the 9/11 staff report on terrorist travel .,Republican
to that end  on january 26th of this year  i introduced h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
the bill  which now has 139 cosponsors  encompasses four of the most important border and document security provisions that the house overwhelmingly approved as a part of h.r.,Republican
10 last year .,Republican
the goal of the real id act is straightforward .,Republican
it seeks to prevent another 9/11-type terrorist attack by disrupting terrorist travel .,Republican
the 9/11 commission terrorist travel report stated that `` abuse of the immigration system and the lack of interior enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activities.,Republican
'' the report further states that `` members of al qaeda clearly valued freedom of movement as critical to their ability to plan and carry out the attacks prior to september 11th.,Republican
'' finally  the report observed  `` if terrorist travel options are reduced  they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents that are more easily detectable.,Republican
'' the real id act contains four provisions aimed at disrupting terrorist travel .,Republican
first  the legislation does not  does not  try to set states ' policy for those who may or may not drive a car  but it does address the use of a driver 's license as a form of identification to a federal official such as an airport screener at a domestic airport .,Republican
american citizens have the right to know who is in their country  that the people are who they say they are  and that the name on the driver 's license is the real holder 's name  not some alias .,Republican
second  this legislation will tighten our asylum system  which has been abused by terrorists .,Republican
the 9/11 commission staff report on terrorist travel states that `` once the terrorists had entered the united states  their next challenge was to find a way to remain here.,Republican
'' their primary method was immigration fraud .,Republican
irresponsible judges have made asylum laws vulnerable to fraud and abuse .,Republican
we will end judge-imposed presumptions that benefit suspected terrorists in order to stop providing a safe haven to some of the worst people on earth .,Republican
the real id act will reduce the opportunity for immigration fraud so that we can protect honest asylum seekers and stop rewarding the terrorists and criminals who falsely claim persecution .,Republican
liberal activist judges in the ninth circuit have been overturning clearly established precedent and are preventing immigration judges from denying bogus asylum applications by aliens who are clearly lying .,Republican
if criminal juries can sentence a defendant to life imprisonment or execution based on adverse credibility determinations  certainly an immigration judge can deny an alien asylum on this basis .,Republican
it is one of the foundations of our system of jurisprudence that juries and trial judges should be able to decide cases on the basis of credibility or lack of credibility of witnesses .,Republican
this bill will again allow immigration judges to deny asylum claims based on the lack of credibility .,Republican
the bill also overturns an even more disturbing ninth circuit precedent that has made it easier for terrorists to receive asylum .,Republican
the circuit has actually held that an alien can receive asylum on the basis that his or her government believes that the alien is a terrorist .,Republican
third  the real id act will waive federal laws to the extent necessary to complete gaps in the san diego border security fence which is still stymied 8 years after congressional authorization .,Republican
neither the public safety nor the environment are benefiting from the current stalemate .,Republican
finally  the real id act contains a common-sense provision that helps protect americans from terrorists who have infiltrated the united states .,Republican
currently  certain terrorism-related grounds of inadmissibility to our country are not also grounds for deportation of aliens already here .,Republican
the real id act makes aliens deportable from the united states for terrorism-related offenses to the same extent they would be inadmissible to the united states to begin with .,Republican
the act provides that any alien who knowingly provides funds or other material support to a terrorist organization will be subject to immigration consequences .,Republican
the real id act will make america a safer place .,Republican
it is even endorsed by the 9/11 families for a secure america  an association of family members of 9/11 victims .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this bill .,Republican

i appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of the bill  and i acknowledge that by agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill  the committee on energy and commerce does not waive its jurisdiction over these provisions .,Republican

james sensenbrenner  jr.  house of representatives  committee on energy and commerce  washington  dc  february 8  2005 .,Republican
dear chairman sensenbrenner : i understand that you will shortly bring h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005  to the house floor .,Republican
this legislation contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce .,Republican
section 102 of the bill provides the secretary of homeland security with the authority to waive applicable environmental law  such as the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  for the purpose of building roads and barriers .,Republican
as you know  rule x of the rules of the house of representatives gives the committee on energy and commerce jurisdiction over these statutes .,Republican
i recognize your desire to bring this legislation before the house in an expeditious manner .,Republican
accordingly  i will not exercise my committee 's right to a referral .,Republican
by agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill  however  the energy and commerce committee does not waive its jurisdiction over h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
in addition  the energy and commerce committee reserves its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any house-senate conference that may be convened on this or similar legislation .,Republican
i ask for your commitment to support any request by the energy and commerce committee for conferees on h.r.,Republican
418 or similar legislation .,Republican
i request that you include this letter in the congressional record during consideration of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
thank you for your attention to these matters .,Republican
sincerely  joe barton  mr.,Republican

mr. chairman  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
smith ) xz4003811 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
chabot ) xz4000710  the chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr.,Republican
hostettler ) xz4001870  the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on immigration .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
forbes ) xz4001370 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Republican
king ) xz4002201 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i claim the time in opposition .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment  and i wish those that were arguing against the amendment read it and see what it says ; and then i think they will be convinced that this is a commonsense change .,Republican
first of all  let me say that the asylum law was designed to provide safe haven to those who are fleeing persecution in their homeland .,Republican
it is not to be used as a crutch for economic migrants who are coming to the united states because the grass is greener on our side of the border .,Republican
now  the bill as it is currently before us takes away the cap of 10  000 approved asylum applicants who are admitted to permanent residency every year .,Republican
the nadler amendment strikes that .,Republican
the bill as it is before us states that the applicant for asylum has the burden of proof to prove that he or she is eligible to receive asylum in our country .,Republican
the nadler amendment strikes it .,Republican
but every petitioner  whether it is a plaintiff in a lawsuit or someone who is applying for social security disability benefits  has got the burden of proof to show that they are entitled to the relief that they are seeking .,Republican
this bill makes it clear that asylum applicants have to make the same burden of proof as others  and the nadler amendment strikes that .,Republican
the other thing that the nadler amendment strikes is a detailed explanation of how the immigration judge is to determine the credibility of the applicant and the witnesses that the applicant and the government put before the judge .,Republican
every trier of fact in court makes the determination based on the credibility of witnesses .,Republican
criminal juries can send someone to their death or to prison for life based on their determination of the credibility of the witnesses  and immigration judges should do so also .,Republican
the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
nadler ) xz4002890 says that 100 percent of the people who show up at the airport claiming asylum are detained .,Republican
that is not right .,Republican
ninety percent of those people are released .,Republican
only 10 percent are detained past the airport .,Republican
the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
nadler ) xz4002890 says that all of the statements or the instances that we raise were pre-1996 law change cases .,Republican
i will give you two that were after that .,Republican
nuradin abdi who was a somali national stood accused of providing material support to al qaeda .,Republican
the government alleged that abdi admitted al qaeda member iyman faris and others initiated a plot to blow up a columbus  ohio  area shopping small .,Republican
mr. abdi was granted asylum in 1999 .,Republican
later after traveling to a terrorist camp in ethiopia  he was arrested when he reentered the united states  and his asylum status was revoked .,Republican
it was revoked  as the u.s. attorney 's office puts it  because with the exception of some minor biographical data  every aspect of the asylum application he submitted was false .,Republican
now  giving a judge an opportunity to deny a claim based upon a determination that the applicant is lying is in my bill and the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
nadler ) xz4002890 tries to strike that .,Republican
again  in 1999 an egyptian national who had been granted asylum  despite the fact that the ins had provided classified evidence that the alien was a known member of a foreign terrorist organization designated by the secretary of state  and according to the committee-hearing witness  the ins submitted a report from a new york city detective showing the alien 's participation in a meeting with the infamous sheik omar abdel rahman  dedicated to planning acts of terrorism in which the pros and cons of hijacking an airplane were discussed .,Republican
he got asylum too .,Republican
now  while it is true that many terrorists are statutorily barred from receiving asylum  members of terrorist organizations are explicitly allowed to receive asylum .,Republican
further  despite any statutory bar to the contrary  asylum regulations and the courts have made it practically impossible for the government to ferret out terrorists who apply .,Republican
there are a number of reasons for this  including the fact that government attorneys are barred from asking foreign governments about any evidence they may possess about the veracity of asylum claims .,Republican
thus  the only evidence available to the government to support an asylum applicant is the lack of credibility to the applicant .,Republican
however  the ninth circuit is preventing immigration judges from denying asylum claims when it is clear that the alien is lying .,Republican
furthermore  the ninth circuit has held that an alien can receive asylum on the very basis that the alien 's government believes he is a terrorist  even if we agree .,Republican
this bill brings back sanity to the asylum laws by overturning these rogue precedents from the ninth circuit .,Republican
and if any jury in the country can convict a defendant based on its determinations of credibility  certainly an immigration judge should be able to do the same thing .,Republican
vote down this amendment  and let us put some common sense into our asylum laws as well as giving hope and shelter to people who can legitimately claim and receive asylum .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr.,Republican
hostettler ) xz4001870  the chairman of the subcommittee on immigration  border security  and claims of the committee on the judiciary .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of the time .,Republican
mr. chairman  several speakers on the other side said that if this bill was law at the time of 9/11  it would not have made any difference on what id the terrorists used to get on the planes .,Republican
that is flat out wrong .,Republican
what the bill say is that anyone who is admitted to this country on a temporary visa will have their driver 's license expire as to the date of their visa .,Republican
now  mohammed atta  who is the ring leader of 9/11 murderers  entered the united states on a 6-month visa .,Republican
that visa expired on july 9  2001 .,Republican
he got a driver 's license from the state of florida on may 5  2001 .,Republican
that was a 6-year driver 's license .,Republican
had this bill been in effect at the time  that driver 's license would have expired on july 9  and he would not have been able to use that driver 's license to get on a plane because it was an expired id .,Republican
read the bill .,Republican
secondly  relative to the asylum issue  what this bill does is two things .,Republican
first of all  it says the burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to prove that they qualify .,Republican
what is wrong with that ?,Republican
the burden of proof is on anybody who is the plaintiff or an applicant in any type of proceeding .,Republican
they have got to prove that they are entitled to the relief that they are requesting  and i will just read from page 3 of the bill .,Republican
in general .,Republican
the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee  within the meaning of the law .,Republican
to establish that the applicant is a refugee  the applicant must establish that race  religion  nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion was or will be the central reason for persecuting the applicant .,Republican
so nobody  nobody who falls under that definition will be denied asylum under this bill .,Republican
secondly  it says that in sustaining the burden  it allows the trier of fact  the immigration judge in this case  to determine the credibility of the witnesses .,Republican
now  the trier of the fact  whether it is a judge or a jury in any other legal proceeding  bases determinations on the credibility of the witnesses as to what verdict is reached .,Republican
without this bill  a person can come before an immigration judge  be determined by that judge that they are lying through their teeth  and still get asylum .,Republican
that is just flat out wrong  and it is a distortion of the type of jurisprudence that we have had where court proceedings are supposed to determine exactly what the truth is .,Republican
there is no one who is lying through their teeth that should be able to get relief from the courts  and i would just point out that this bill would give immigration judges the tool to get at the blind sheik who wanted to blow up landmarks in new york  the man who plotted and executed the bombing of the world trade center in new york  the man who shot up the entrance to the cia headquarters in northern virginia  and the man who shot up the el al counter at los angeles international airport .,Republican
every one of these non-9/11 terrorists who tried to kill or did kill honest  law-abiding americans was an asylum applicant .,Republican
we ought to give our judges the opportunity to tell these people no and to pass the bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i have the right to close and will close after the gentleman yields his time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of the time .,Republican
mr. chairman  contrary to what my distinguished friend from new jersey says  there are no onerous new requirements to meet the standard for asylum .,Republican
page 2 of the managers amendment incorporated in the bill says the applicant has to establish that he is a refugee within the meaning of this section .,Republican
the applicant must establish that race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular cultural group or political opinion was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant .,Republican
now  that means that all of the jewish people who were turned away on the st .,Republican
louis prior to the second world war would have qualified because they were being persecuted in nazi germany because of their religion .,Republican
people who have been engaged in what was used to be called anti-soviet activities in the former soviet union  that was a political opinion  they would have been eligible for asylum .,Republican
and the comments that the gentleman from new jersey makes about torture are simply not true .,Republican
this bill does not impact the obligations of the united states under the convention to prevent torture by prohibiting the deportation of people to countries that torture them .,Republican
now  simply what is stated is that the burden of proof is on the applicant  just like it ought to be  like it is on our constituents who apply for social security disability .,Republican
and it sets up standards for determining the credibility of the witness .,Republican
if the witness comes and says  gee  i made a mistake because i forgot the birth date and admits to that mistake  that certainly is exonerating evidence .,Republican
vote down the amendment .,Republican
all of these arguments are a red herring .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from indiana ( mr.,Republican
pence ) xz4003150 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170  our recently returned prodigal son .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of this rule for consideration of amendments to h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act .,Republican
the manager 's amendment  which will self-execute upon adoption of this resolution  makes technical changes to the bill as well as making a number of substantive improvements .,Republican
one such modification will be to remove the annual cap on the number of aliens granted asylum who can become permanent residents each year .,Republican
the current cap of 10  000 has resulted in a multi-year backlog that has caused unnecessary hardship to aliens already found to have been fleeing persecution .,Republican
hardly an anti-refugee provision .,Republican
the manager 's amendment also extends the bill 's provisions regarding the credibility determinations of immigration judges in asylum proceedings to apply to other requests for relief from removal before immigration judges .,Republican
lastly  it includes the text of h.r.,Republican
100  introduced by the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
dreier ) xz4001150  to limit criminal aliens to one bite of the apple in contesting their removal orders .,Republican
i strongly support all these changes and believe they improve the underlying legislation .,Republican
regrettably  at the request of the committee on government reform  the manager 's amendment also removes two provisions that i believe address important issues with regard to temporary licenses .,Republican
one provision clarified the need to clearly mark temporary driver 's licenses that states remain authorized to issue people who can not meet the identity standards as set by this bill .,Republican
the other provision provided the secretary of dhs with the ability to intervene  but only in the interest of national security  to reduce the incredible diversity in form and appearance of driver 's licenses issued by the states .,Republican
today there are over 350 valid driver 's license designs issued by the 50 states .,Republican
and we all know it is very difficult for security officials at airports to tell the real id cards from the counterfeit ones .,Republican
i understand why the chairman of the committee on government reform believes these two provisions should not be included at this time ; however  it is my hope that as this legislation continues to move through the legislative process  we may revisit these two provisions .,Republican
both are widely supported and improve the overall bill .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  and i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
reclaiming my time  i appreciate the gentleman from wisconsin 's ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 point .,Republican
in the meantime  i believe we will have some work to do in the weeks ahead and i look forward to working with the gentleman and with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 and others to solve this problem .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
dreier ) xz4001150  a close adviser of governor schwarzenegger and the chairman of the committee on rules .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
royce ) xz4003480 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910  another big supporter of governor schwarzenegger .,Republican
mr. speaker  this bill does not require the states to do anything or not do anything .,Republican
it has been very clear from the beginning of the debate on this legislation .,Republican
what the bill does is it says that a driver 's license has to meet certain standards if it is to be acceptable for federal id purposes  such as getting on an airplane .,Republican
what the motion to recommit does is force the states to do something  or not do something ; and that goes directly against the notion of federalism that is contained in this bill and which was drafted by the committee on government reform .,Republican
the first vote that we had yesterday on this legislation was on whether we should waive the law relative to unfunded mandates .,Republican
the vote on that was 228 `` aye '' to 191 `` no. '' the author of this motion to recommit  as well as the 190 who joined him in saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law  is now asking the states to have another unfunded mandate .,Republican
i would urge all of the 191 who voted `` no '' on the jackson-lee objection to consideration of the rule to bring this up to join me in voting `` no '' on this motion to recommit  together with the 228 who voted the right way yesterday .,Republican
vote `` no '' on the motion to recommit ; vote `` aye '' on passage .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank him for his hard work on this conference report .,Republican
as many in this chamber know  this conference report contains the provisions of the real id act  which i offered  and the house overwhelmingly approved earlier this year .,Republican
the sensible reforms contained in this legislation are long overdue and will make america safer .,Republican
these provisions will hamper the ability of terrorists and criminal aliens to move freely through our society by requiring that all states ' prior proof of lawful presence in the u.s. for their driver 's licenses be accepted as identification for federal purposes  such as boarding a commercial airplane  entering a federal building or a nuclear power plant .,Republican
this legislation will also require a temporary driver 's license issued to a foreign visitor to expire when their visa expires  with the maximum term of 1 year .,Republican
the legislation will also prevent the ability of potentially dangerous aliens to show up under false pretenses on our shores and be granted safe haven  while simultaneously protecting those who are legitimately fleeing persecution .,Republican
finally  the legislation will also ensure that the security and integrity of our border is not imperiled by endless and frivolous litigation .,Republican
i would also note that there are several immigration-related provisions included in the report by the other body that enjoy broad support from this house .,Republican
one will provide that aliens who have received h-2b visas issued to work in temporary or seasonal jobs in any of the last 3 years shall not be counted toward the 2005 or 2006 quotes when applying for an h-2b visa during the next 2 years .,Republican
another amendment expands immigrant visas available for aliens who serve as nurses or physical therapists .,Republican
i wish to thank the house leadership  the white house  and many members of both chambers who rightly recognized the importance of the real id act and supported its inclusion in this conference report .,Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 71 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i will perhaps apologize to the gentlewoman from texas .,Republican
i had thought that the minority was well equipped to have a document which i will enter into the record from the congressional budget office  a cost estimate dated february 7  2005  concerning h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005  which is a summary of the issues that the gentlewoman from texas is bringing up .,Republican
the information that the gentlewoman is referencing is addressed within this document by the cbo .,Republican
if i could  i would like to summarize for the gentlewoman  pending such time as we get her a copy of this  and i apologize that evidently one has not been provided to her .,Republican
and i quote : `` as a result  the additional costs that would be imposed by h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005  would not exceed the annual threshold established in the unfunded mandates act  $ 62 million in 2005  '' which is the annual adjustment rate for inflation .,Republican
this bill authorized appropriations for grants to states and appropriations would be under that amount .,Republican
and i would be pleased to make sure that the gentlewoman has that at this time .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 -- real id act of 2005 summary : h.r.,Republican
418 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to make grants to states to cover the costs of improving the security of driver 's licenses as required by the bill .,Republican
the legislation also would make changes to current immigration law that aim to prevent the entry of suspected terrorists into the united states .,Republican
cbo estimates that implementing h.r.,Republican
418 would cost about $ 100 million over the 2005-2010 period  assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts .,Republican
enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or receipts .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 contains several intergovernmental mandates as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act ( umra ) .,Republican
cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs on state  local  and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law .,Republican
cbo estimates that costs to those governments will total more than $ 100 million over the 2005-2009 period under current law .,Republican
by comparison  we estimate that such costs would total about $ 120 million ( over the 2006-2010 period ) under h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
as a result  the additional costs that would be imposed by h.r.,Republican
418 would not exceed the annual threshold established in umra ( $ 62 million in 2005  adjusted annually for inflation ) .,Republican
the bill would authorize appropriations for grants to states to cover their costs .,Republican
this bill contains no new private-sector mandates as defined in umra .,Republican
estimated cost to the federal government : the estimated budgetary impact of h.r.,Republican
418 is shown in the following table .,Republican
the costs of this legislation fall within budget function 750 ( administration of justice ) .,Republican
basis of estimate : the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( pub .,Republican
l. 108-458 ) authorized the appropriation of such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for the department of transportation to make grants to states to cover the costs of improving the security of driver 's licenses as required by that act .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 would repeal those provisions of public law 108-458  shift the responsibility of administering this program from the department of transportation to dhs  and require state and local governments to comply with more stringent provisions than under current law .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for dhs to make grants to states to cover the costs of complying with the bill 's provisions .,Republican
requirements for driver 's licenses and identification cards public law 108-458 created federal standards for issuing driver 's licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates on state  local  and some tribal governments .,Republican
that law  however  gave broad authority to the department of transportation to negotiate the specific requirements of those standards .,Republican
based on information from federal  state  and local agencies  cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards ; those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
in contrast  the provisions of h.r.,Republican
418 are more specific and likely would go beyond what will be required under current law .,Republican
specifically  state-licensing agencies would be required to verify the documents presented as proof of identification  residency  and citizenship status .,Republican
many of the agencies that issue those documents charge a fee for verification services .,Republican
licensing agencies also would have to upgrade computer systems to verify documents and to digitize and store electronic copies of all source documents .,Republican
finally  some states that do not currently require background checks for certain employees would face additional costs to complete those checks .,Republican
cbo estimates that these additional requirements in h.r.,Republican
418 would impose costs above those incurred under current law .,Republican
based on information from state representatives  cbo estimates that dhs would spend about $ 20 million over the five-year period to reimburse states for the cost of complying with the legislation  subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts .,Republican
driver license agreement in addition  h.r.,Republican
418 would require states to participate in the driver license agreement  an interstate database to share driver information that was not included in public law 108-458 .,Republican
based on information from the government accountability office and the american association of motor vehicle administrators  cbo estimates that it would cost $ 80 million over three years to reimburse states for the cost to establish and maintain the database .,Republican
barriers at u.s.-mexico border the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act provided for the construction of a series of roads and fences along the u.s.-mexico border near san diego to deter entry of illegal immigrants .,Republican
all but about three miles of this barrier have been completed .,Republican
since february 2004  completion of the barrier has been delayed because of environmental conflicts with the coastal zone management act ( czma ) .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418 would permit dhs to waive this act and any other laws as necessary to complete construction of the barrier .,Republican
dhs estimates that it has spent about $ 30 million thus far on the barrier and that it will cost an additional $ 32 million to complete the project .,Republican
the agency has less than $ 2 million in unspent funds  which are currently being used to identify acceptable alternative plans to complete the barrier .,Republican
in addition  the czma already enables the president under certain circumstances to waive laws as necessary to complete projects deemed of paramount interest to the united states .,Republican
other provisions finally  cbo estimates that the bill 's provisions  designed to prevent the entry of suspected terrorists into the united states  would have no significant costs because similar screening procedures already exist .,Republican
estimated impact on state  local  and tribal governments : procedures for processing and issuing driver 's licenses and identification cards under current law are in the process of changing due to federal legislation enacted in december 2004 .,Republican
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 created federal standards for states to follow in issuing driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Republican
cbo considers these standards to be mandates because any driver 's licenses or identification cards issued after that time would be invalid for federal identification purposes unless they met those requirements .,Republican
cbo estimates that those enacted mandates will impose costs on state  local  and some tribal governments over the 2005-2009 period totaling new mandates with significant additional costs h.r.,Republican
418 would repeal public law 108-458 and replace it with several new and more stringent intergovernmental mandates for processing and issuing driver 's licenses and identification cards .,Republican
based on information from federal agency and state representatives  cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs on state  local  and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law .,Republican
cbo estimates that costs to those governments will total more than $ 100 million over the 2005-2009 period under current law .,Republican
by comparison  we estimate that such costs would total about $ 120 million ( over the 2006-2010 period ) under h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
as a result  the additional costs that would be imposed by h.r.,Republican
418 would not exceed the annual threshold established in umra ( $ 62 million in 2005  adjusted annually for inflation ) .,Republican
the bill would authorize appropriations for grants to states to cover their costs .,Republican
public law 108-458 created federal standards for issuing driver 's licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates on state  local  and some tribal governments .,Republican
that law  however  gave broad authority to the secretary of the department of transportation to negotiate the specific requirements of those standards .,Republican
based on information from state and local government representatives  cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards ; those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements of this bill .,Republican
in contrast  the provisions of h.r.,Republican
418 are more specific and likely would go beyond what will be required under current law .,Republican
specifically  state-licensing agencies would be required to verify with the issuing agency ( many that charge a fee for such verifications ) each document presented as proof of identification  residency  and citizenship status .,Republican
those state agencies also would have to upgrade computer systems to verify documents and to digitize and store electronic copies of all source documents .,Republican
finally  certain states that do not currently require background checks for certain employees would face additional costs to complete those checks .,Republican
cbo estimates that these additional requirements in h.r.,Republican
418 would impose costs above those that will be imposed by the mandates in current law .,Republican
the incremental additional costs  however  are unlikely  by themselves  to exceed the annual threshold established in umra in any one year .,Republican
mandates with no significant additional costs the bill also contains several other intergovernmental mandates .,Republican
cbo expects  however  that these requirements would probably not impose significant additional costs on state  local  or tribal governments .,Republican
specifically  the bill would : authorize the secretary of the department of homeland security to waive any laws necessary to complete construction of a physical barrier between the united states and mexico near san diego  california  and prohibit any court from having jurisdiction to hear claims or ordering relief for damage resulting from the waiver of such laws .,Republican
this provision would preempt state authority .,Republican
require states to implement training classes for employees to identify fraudulent documents ; and require documents and supplies to be securely stored .,Republican
according to state officials  it is likely that states currently comply with those requirements .,Republican
prohibit states from accepting any foreign document  other than an official passport  for identification purposes for the issuance of driver 's licenses .,Republican
currently  at least 10 states accept identification cards issued by foreign governments  such as the `` matricula consular '' issued by mexico .,Republican
this prohibition would preempt state authority .,Republican
require states to resolve any discrepancies that arise from verifying social security numbers  though the language is unclear as to what specific actions would be required .,Republican
currently  at least two states prohibit their employees from enforcing immigration laws  and many of those discrepancies may be related to immigration .,Republican
this requirement might preempt those state laws .,Republican
require that driver 's licenses and identification cards be valid for no more than eight years .,Republican
currently two states  arizona and colorado  are valid for longer than eight years .,Republican
these provisions would preempt those state laws and impose two to four years of additional staff costs to reissue the licenses sooner than expected .,Republican
those costs would not be incurred until eight years after the bill is enacted .,Republican
in addition  four other states -- montana  new mexico  oregon  and wisconsin -- issue driver 's licenses and identification cards that are valid for eight years .,Republican
the bill authorizes the secretary to further limit the validity of licenses and these states  as well as others  may be affected if the secretary exercises such authority .,Republican
this provision would preempt state authority .,Republican
authorize the secretary to prescribe the design formats of driver 's licenses and identification cards to protect national security and allow for clear visual differentiation between levels and categories of documents .,Republican
such design has traditionally been determined by states and under current law ; any standards developed under the provisions of public law 108-458 may not require a single design .,Republican
this provision would preempt state authority .,Republican
other impacts on state and local governments in addition to the other requirements of the bill  states would be required to participate in the driver license agreement  an interstate compact to share driver information .,Republican
any costs to state governments would be incurred voluntarily as a condition of receiving federal assistance .,Republican
estimated impact on the private sector : this bill contains no new private-sector mandates as defined in umra .,Republican
estimate prepared by : federal costs : mark grabowicz ; impact on state  local  and tribal governments : melissa merrell ; and impact on the private sector : paige piper/bach .,Republican
estimate approved by : peter h. fontaine  deputy assistant director for budget analysis .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  i do appreciate and respect the gentleman from michigan 's joining with the gentlewoman from texas in bringing this issue before the house today .,Republican
i would offer perhaps a different vision or view of the words that the gentleman has spoken .,Republican
i believe that the republican majority did sponsor the legislation for the unfunded mandates act ; however  i believe at the time that was done  there was a general understanding that unfunded mandates would have a threshold that was necessary to be met so that we would have to appropriately understand those items when we would have an unfunded mandate that would be necessary for us to understand what we were placing upon the states or municipalities that we would not then appropriate money to .,Republican
the gentleman is at least correct that the republican majority did introduce this legislation and pass it .,Republican
however  the threshold that was established at that time  now as a result of inflation several years later  we are aware of  and that is why we have made sure to ask the question about what we are imposing on states for this very important issue that is within the jurisdiction of these states  but as a result of the needs of this great nation to address driver 's license inconsistencies and the integrity behind those .,Republican
we believe it is necessary .,Republican
so for the gentleman to bring this point of order with the gentlewoman from texas  purely appropriate  i would remind all of my colleagues that we have addressed this issue  that cbo has been very clear that we do not reach those thresholds which would trigger this sort of point of order .,Republican
so i would ask that my colleagues would pay attention not only to this argument but to understand that we have not violated any rule as it relates to the unfunded mandate .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  we have had an opportunity to hear from the gentlewoman from texas about a document that is old  that contained the best estimate and work at the time from the congressional budget office .,Republican
i have made available to the gentlewoman from texas and for each and every member of this body to see that the congressional budget office has very clearly talked about the costs that would be associated with what might be known as an unfunded mandate .,Republican
we believe  and they have concurred from the congressional budget office that we are well within budgetary amounts to where we would not trigger this unfunded mandate clause .,Republican
i think it is important that we do have this law .,Republican
i am glad we have debates over how much burden we are placing upon states or municipalities  but in this case  i would urge my colleagues to understand that we have the official document that is as of yesterday by the congressional budget office ; and i would ask that they would support our position  knowing that we have fallen within the rules of the house .,Republican
mr. speaker  as a result of this  i would simply say that our position is  we value and hold and believe we are well within the rules of the house of representatives .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to this amendment which continues to have endless litigation against plugging the hole in the fence south of san diego .,Republican
we were able to win world war ii quicker than we were able to complete this fence .,Republican
i think that shows why this amendment is a bad one .,Republican
i want to tell the membership the short story that illustrates why the fence has to be completed .,Republican
in early january  i sent two of my staff personally to inspect this area .,Republican
on the day they visited the imperial beach station at the border patrol  they asked to see a demonstration of the afis fingerprint system used to identify criminal aliens among those caught across the border .,Republican
a man picked at random from a holding area of high-risk detainees  who had been apprehended the night before  was selected for fingerprint check .,Republican
within 15 minutes the system returned a rap sheet that was 17 pages long .,Republican
crimes he committed across three different states included abusing his spouse  raping his daughter and multiple counts of theft .,Republican
this man was apprehended not far from smuggler 's gulch and came through the area where the fence is not complete .,Republican
the border patrol says he is typical of the one in three aliens they apprehend coming through the 3-mile unfenced area along the beach .,Republican
this person is a criminal  and membership of the california delegation complained about the cost of california incarcerating criminal aliens .,Republican
we can cut down that cost and incarcerate fewer criminal aliens by plugging the hole in this fence and keeping them south of the border .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purposes of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
hastings ) xz4001701  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only .,Republican
this general debate rule provides for 1 hour and 40 minutes of general debate  with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary  40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on government reform  and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on homeland security .,Republican
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill  and provides that after general debate the committee of the whole shall rise without motion and no further consideration shall be in order except by subsequent order of the house .,Republican
mr. speaker  we are here today to begin the debate on fulfilling congress 's promise to the american people made in the wake of the tragedy of september 11  2001  that our government will do everything it can to protect them from another deadly attack on our homeland .,Republican
this promise was made in the days immediately following september 11 when president bush committed to the american people that the full force of american power would be used to bring terrorists and their sponsors to justice .,Republican
this promise was continued by the efforts of the september 11 commission and the subsequent efforts of congress to study the frailties and oversights of our national security system that the 9/11 terrorists were able to identify  exploit and use against us .,Republican
and this promise will continue again today through the consideration of the real id act of 2005  which has been authored by my good friend  the chairman of the committee on the judiciary  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 .,Republican
this legislation continues the reform mission begun by congress in the 9/11 recommendations implementation act .,Republican
by implementing the additional security measures including the real id act  congress will help to ensure that our borders are secure  that terrorists can not travel to america  and that the rule of law is respected by those who come to our nation .,Republican
the narrowly constructed legislation by the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 accomplishes this goal by focusing on four common-sense areas : implementing much-needed driver 's license reform  closing the asylum loopholes  defending our borders  and strengthening our deportation laws .,Republican
implementing the driver 's license reforms included in h.r.,Republican
418 will provide greater security for the american people because lax standards and loopholes in the various current state issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain a driver 's license  often multiple drivers ' licenses from different states  and abuse these fake identities for illegal and harmful purposes .,Republican
the september 11 hijackers had within their position at least 15 valid driver 's licenses and numerous state-issued identification cards listing a wide variety of addresses .,Republican
these terrorists were able to exploit many of the benefits conferred upon them by the possession of these cards  such as enabling the bearer to acquire other corroborating identification documents  transfer funds to u.s. bank accounts  obtain access to federal buildings  purchase a firearm  rent a car or board a plane  just to name a few .,Republican
by establishing minimum document and issuance standards for the federal acceptance of driver 's licenses  requiring applicants to prove that they are in the country legally  and requiring identification documents to expire simultaneously with the expiration of lawful entry status  this legislation will ensure that individuals harboring malicious intent who have illegally entered or who are unlawfully present in the united states  can not have access to these valuable and sensitive documents .,Republican
closing the asylum loopholes identified by h.r.,Republican
418 will provide greater security for the american people because as the 9/11 commission staff report noted  `` a number of terrorists ... ..,Republican
abused the asylum system.,Republican
'' by strengthening judges ' ability to determine whether asylum-seekers are truthful and credible  we will be able to prevent future terrorists from gaming the system by applying for asylum as a means to avoid deportation after all other recourses for remaining in the united states have been denied to them .,Republican
this will prevent abuses to the system like the case of the `` blind sheik '' abdul rahman  who was able to stay in the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing on the asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center .,Republican
defending our physical borders  as provided for in the real id bill  will provide greater security for the american people .,Republican
we know from the 9/11 commission that the hijackers had 25 contacts with consular officers and 43 contacts with immigration and customs authorities .,Republican
as a result  the 9/11 commission and congress have recommended and taken a number of appropriate actions that have made it more difficult for terrorists to enter the united states through the visa or other legal immigration process ; and this bill will go even further toward attaining that goal .,Republican
but closing down only the legal means by which they will try to enter and infiltrate our country is simply not enough .,Republican
because increased vigilance has made entering the country through normal  regular channels more difficult  we must also be increasingly prepared for the certainty that terrorists will try to use illegal  clandestine methods to enter our country and to do us harm  and we must now take steps to close those gaps in our border security where we are most vulnerable .,Republican
finally  strengthening our deportation laws as provided for by h.r.,Republican
418 will provide greater security for the american people .,Republican
currently  although it seems unbelievable  not all terrorism-related grounds for keeping an alien out of the u.s. are also grounds for deportation .,Republican
this means that terrorists and their closest advocates can be denied entry to the united states for their actions in support of terrorism  but if they are able to make it to our shores  we can not deport them for those same actions .,Republican
the real id act would bring some common sense to this troubling oversight and make the law consistent by providing that all terrorist-related offenses that make aliens inadmissible would also be grounds for deportation .,Republican
it would also provide that any alien contributing funds to a terrorist organization would also be deportable .,Republican
mr. speaker  this rule is intended to allow debate to begin on this important legislation and to give members an opportunity to come to the floor and to voice their support or concerns about its contents as the committee on rules finalizes an appropriate rule for consideration of possible amendments .,Republican
i encourage all of my colleagues to improve america 's national security by supporting this rule to begin the debate on this legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  the gentlewoman from texas has politely articulated something that i believe is misguided and inappropriate .,Republican
the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress in knowing in a nonpartisan way those impacts of the laws that we pass  and i have respectfully made sure that the gentlewoman had a copy and had been advised that before she came to the floor  evidently  the minority was in possession of this new document of 2005 .,Republican
and the committee on rules  in a meeting that we had yesterday where we considered this legislation  had to understand the implications or some of the implications as it related to this act  and we rely upon the current information that has come from the congressional budget office .,Republican
so i am very disappointed that my colleague has chosen to think that we have placed pressure upon this professional organization  that we have fudged the numbers ; and i would say to the gentlewoman from texas that that  i believe  is not only an unfair accusation to this member but  more specifically  to the congressional budget office  which i believe is a professional organization  delivers a product that they put their name on and makes available to all who might read it .,Republican
so i respectfully disagree with the gentlewoman  do not accept the characterization that she has given to this member or to the congressional budget office  and would hope that the gentlewoman would find the time perhaps later in the day to bring this issue up upon full scrutiny of the documentation to recognize that  in fact  the professional conduct of the congressional budget office was correct in their assertion .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
reclaiming my time  i thank the chairman .,Republican
i would ask the chairman  is it his understanding that the administration has the authority under the stafford act to remove debris from the private lands when it is in the public interest ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i would like to inquire of the time remaining for both sides .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650  chairman of the committee on the judiciary .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
shadegg ) xz4003680  the chairman of the republican policy committee .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas  ( mr.,Republican
gohmert ) xz4006510 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr.,Republican
sullivan ) xz4003920 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
gingrey ) xz4001510  one of the bright new members of the committee on rules .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
blunt ) xz4000340  our whip .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
dreier ) xz4001150  the favorite son from san dimas  chairman of the committee on rules .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time  and i move the previous question on the resolution .,Republican
the previous question was ordered .,Republican
the resolution was agreed to .,Republican
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  i do understand that not everybody is in agreement about what we are doing today  but for the members that are paying attention  the 9/11 terrorist travel report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states  known as the 9/11 commission  said on page 43  and i would like to quote this : `` september 11 : as the hijackers boarded four flights  american airlines flights 11 and 77  and united airlines flights 93 and 175  at least six hijackers used u.s. identification documents obtained and acquired in the previous months  three of which were fraudulently obtained in northern virginia.,Republican
'' mr.,Republican
speaker  we would have to really not respect this 9/11 commission if we were not going to follow up on the work that they did .,Republican
that is why we are here today .,Republican
we are here for the best reason  for the security of this great nation and the wonderful people who care and entrust upon the united states congress the ability to make sure we do all that we can to avoid attacks in the future .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
hastings ) xz4001701  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only .,Republican
the rule under consideration completes the work begun by the general debate rule passed yesterday by the house .,Republican
it provides for further consideration of the rule under a structured rule and provides that no further general debate shall be in order .,Republican
this rule provides that the amendment printed in part a of the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole and that the bill  as amended  shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment and shall be considered as read .,Republican
it makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the report and provides that these amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report and only by a member designated in the report .,Republican
these amendments shall be considered as read  shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent  shall not be subject to amendment  and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole .,Republican
finally  this rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the report and provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions .,Republican
mr. speaker  this rule will complete the work begun yesterday on h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
as a number of our colleagues have already made it very clear during the debate yesterday of an hour and 40 minutes  this legislation will continue the efforts of our president  george w. bush  the 9/11 commission  and of congress to ensure that america never suffers another terrorist attack like the tragedy of september 11  2001 .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
418  authored by the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) will improve security by focusing on four main areas : number one  implementing much-needed driver 's license reform  closing asylum loopholes  defending our borders  and strengthening our deportation laws .,Republican
implementing the driver 's license reforms included in h.r.,Republican
418 will provide for greater security for the american people .,Republican

it would also provide that any alien contributing funds to a terrorist organization could also be deportable .,Republican
this rule makes in order five amendments from members from both sides of the aisle  including one that i have submitted to ensure that aliens and terrorists who are in the united states and ordered deported are actually deported so that they can no longer pose a threat to the security of american citizens .,Republican
by supporting this rule  the house can complete its consideration of these five important amendments and the underlying legislation .,Republican
i urge all of my colleagues to support this fair and balanced rule .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 75 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican

the previous question was ordered .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
this rule makes in order five amendments for members of both sides of the aisle  including one that i have submitted to ensure that aliens and terrorists are not in the united states illegally  and if they are  we are going to deport them .,Republican
i think that this is a good bill  a good rule ; and i support h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
we need to implement much-needed driver 's license reform .,Republican
we need to close asylum loopholes .,Republican
we need to defend our borders  and we are going to strengthen our deportation laws .,Republican
and i encourage all of my colleagues to support the underlying legislation in this rule .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  in august 2004  the bipartisan chairman of the 9/11 commission testified at the select committee on homeland security that border security combined with the routine and effective enforcement of immigration laws must be a top priority for congress and the administration if our country can expect to secure the homeland and prevent another tragedy like what happened on 9/11 from happening again here in america .,Republican
the 9/11 commission report states on page 384 that `` looking back  we can also see that the routine operations of our immigration laws  that is  aspects of the laws not specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al qaeda 's planning and opportunities.,Republican
'' there is no more basic homeland security function of our legal system than deporting aliens who have been afforded due process and who have subsequently been ordered deported by a federal judge .,Republican
sadly  according to our government 's best statistics  only 13 percent of the aliens arrested entering the country illegally and ordered deported are actually removed .,Republican
as a result  people entering the country illegally with criminal or terrorist intent have quickly learned that  if arrested  they can be quickly released on their own word  and that they can be confident in the knowledge that they do not have to show up for their hearing  knowing they will likely never be deported .,Republican
my amendment seeks to remedy this threat to our safety by clarifying the use of delivery bonds by the department of homeland security .,Republican
this concept is nothing new .,Republican
the authority to leverage delivery bonds to compel attendance at federal deportation proceedings already exists in federal law .,Republican
the department simply needs guidance from congress on how to best use its existing bond authority to reach the goal of 100 percent repatriation of all aliens ordered deported  and that is exactly what my amendment will provide .,Republican
quite simply  the amendment makes certain before an alien is released from department of homeland security detention pending an upcoming hearing  the federal judge must first certify that the alien is not a flight risk  and more important  that he does not pose a security risk to the united states .,Republican
by improving this routine and fundamental operation of our laws  my amendment will limit terrorists ' planning and opportunities to attack americans here at home  and to begin fulfilling what the 9/11 commission identified last summer as a top priority for congress .,Republican
i ask that all members of this house support my amendment and build upon the strong deportation reform initiatives already included in h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
smith ) xz4003811  a former subcommittee chairman for the committee on the judiciary .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for asking .,Republican
the impetus behind this is  these are aliens who have been ordered deported by a federal judge as a result of a hearing  who do not show up .,Republican
they have had their day in court .,Republican
the process is through .,Republican
they have been ordered deported  and only 13 percent actually are deported .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ( ms.,Republican
ginny brown-waite ) .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
this amendment that i have comes as a result of my paying attention to not only the 9/11 commission  but also my service to the select committee on homeland security in the prior congress .,Republican
it was very obvious to members of the committee  as we heard testimony  including from the immigration and naturalization service 's inspector general report from the department of justice where they recognized the deficiencies that they had  where a person who had gone through an entire process in front of a federal judge was ordered removed and yet only 13 percent of those were removed from the country .,Republican
we have a problem .,Republican
we have a problem that was enumerated in the 9/11 commission report .,Republican
we are utilizing the techniques that are not only available in the law  but also that many courts utilize today  federal courts as well as city and state courts across the united states .,Republican
we need to make sure that people who have gone through a hearing have been given the opportunity to make sure that they can present their case  but then have been ordered deported do so .,Republican
the united states and  i think  members of this congress need to make sure that the things which we do  we give the tools to implement those necessary ways to enforce the laws of the united states to be done ; for those who have been ordered to be deported and have not done so  we are giving them a better tool kit .,Republican
that is why the sessions amendment is being offered .,Republican
i support this  and i hope the members will vote `` aye '' on the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. chairman  the castle amendment is a sensible amendment to the base bill  and i thank the gentleman from delaware for offering it .,Republican
people who present a false driver 's license to the transportation security administration are turned over to the proper authorities  but for some reason that is beyond me we do not add these people to our flight watch list .,Republican
it blows me away that we do not already utilize this commonsense practice .,Republican
improving the information contained in passenger screening databases will enhance our ability to identify potential terrorists from gaining access to airlines .,Republican
we have taken some important steps to improve our security at airports  but we need to do more .,Republican
this amendment enhances our last line of defense by tracking potential high-risk passengers without interfering with the rights of everyday travelers .,Republican
it just makes so much good sense  and i hope that we adopt it quickly .,Republican
mr. chairman  welcome to the world of mohammed atta : legal visa to come in  6 months ; driver 's license from florida  6 years .,Republican
like many in this chamber  i was a strong supporter of the intelligence reform legislation passed last year  but when i voted for it  i believed we needed to go further in several areas  including strengthening driver 's license guidelines .,Republican
in my home state of connecticut  we take strong steps to ensure the integrity of our identification cards  but we are not perfect .,Republican
to receive a driver 's license in connecticut  you must prove you are a legal resident of the state  and you are not a legal resident of the state if you are not legally present in the united states  period .,Republican
this is common sense to me .,Republican
driver 's licenses are verifiable forms of identification in the united states .,Republican
providing such identification cards to people who are illegally present in our country presents serious concerns .,Republican
the problem  however  is that not all states maintain this high standard .,Republican
that means that someone who is illegally present in the united states and takes advantage of a weak law in another state can obtain a driver 's license and use the document to identify him or herself in the state of connecticut .,Republican
they can also use that document to access federal buildings  rent a vehicle or get on a plane .,Republican
tightening access to state-issued identification cards is an important and necessary improvement for our homeland security .,Republican
many members have raised concerns about the impact of driver 's license provisions in h.r.,Republican
418 in our home states .,Republican
connecticut governor jodi rell stated  `` in my view  if a noncitizen is lawfully in this country  he or she should be able to obtain a driver 's license for the time frame in which he is lawfully allowed to be here .,Republican
conversely  if someone is in this country illegally  he or she should not be able to obtain a driver 's license in connecticut or any other state.,Republican
'' i could not agree more with her .,Republican
frankly  most of our constituents could not agree more with her .,Republican
let me raise one other point about this legislation and commend the chairman for including this provision .,Republican
a legally present visitor to the united states can obtain a driver 's license in connecticut  as he can in other states .,Republican
however  in connecticut we issue licenses for 6 years at a time .,Republican
in that time  visitors can leave and come back  whether legally or illegally  an untold number of times .,Republican
during subsequent visits  this person can continue to use the license for whatever purpose he or she wants .,Republican
this is wrong .,Republican
frankly  it is stupid .,Republican
requiring a temporary id for persons temporarily in our country is a no-brainer .,Republican
i do not think mohammed atta would like it  but  i do not care what he wants .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of the nadler amendment and ask members  especially on my side of the aisle  to join us in striking section 101 .,Republican
section 101 purports to reform asylum -- but it does not .,Republican
under the pretext that it mitigates terrorists ' access to the united states  the provision actually does a grave injustice and disservice to the persecuted  such as religious believers  and all others who have a well-founded fear of persecution and who seek asylum in our country .,Republican
section 101 imposes onerous new requirements on the persecuted  including those who have been traumatized by rape  torture  trafficking  and religious hate and persecution  to prove the persecutor 's motive .,Republican
read the language .,Republican
you have got to prove that persecution was a central reason you left and why you are seeking asylum .,Republican
i would remind my colleagues that i have been in congress 25 years .,Republican
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes never persecute .,Republican
it is always some other pretext  whether it be the people 's republic of china  vietnam  cuba .,Republican
when it was romania many years back  there was always a false reason .,Republican
slander against the soviet state was used over and over again  never because you were jewish or christian or because you were an evangelical or some other reason .,Republican
they always have a pretext .,Republican
i can guarantee if this is enacted into law that real asylum seekers will be denied  and then the piling on just begins to start .,Republican
how many members have met persecuted people  traumatized people who are coming to our borders ?,Republican
they get their stories wrong .,Republican
according to this language  if they have any inconsistency  even if it is not germane to the issue at hand  if they get a date wrong  how many members have forgotten their wife 's birthday  date or year ?,Republican
we all make mistakes .,Republican
get one of those things wrong and the trier of facts can exclude you based on that single situation .,Republican
this is an ugly provision .,Republican
i say with respect to my friend and colleague from wisconsin  i am against terrorism .,Republican
9/11 hurt people in my district .,Republican
they were hurt big time .,Republican
this is an ugly provision  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
it has not had  in my view  the kind of hearing needed in terms of the consequences that it will impose upon true asylum seekers .,Republican
i hope members will vote against this .,Republican
i have authored 3 torture victims relief laws to help torture victims .,Republican
i meet with a lot of torture victims .,Republican
they forget ; they have been traumatized .,Republican
you forget something pursuant to these new requirements and you are a goner .,Republican
you are being deported back to that country of origin where you have been persecuted .,Republican
please vote against section 101 .,Republican
vote for the nadler amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  for the last two decades  the united nations population fund ( unfpa )  has shockingly defended the coercive chinese population control program .,Republican
by refusing to give american tax dollars to the unfpa  the united states stands solidly with the victims and against the oppressors .,Republican
we must continue to do so as long as unfpa insists on supporting the chinese program .,Republican
today  representative maloney offered an amendment to h.r.,Republican
1268  the `` emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense  the global war on terror  and tsunami relief ''  and she described the amendment as something that would give $ 3 million to unfpa .,Republican
even though she explained it as a unfpa amendment  i want to clarify that the language of the amendment could in no way be construed to support or give funding to unfpa .,Republican
in fact  the amendment does not even mention unfpa .,Republican
the maloney amendment says  in chapter 1 of title ii of the bill  in the item relating to the `` economic support fund ''  after the first dollar amount  insert `` ( reduced by $ 3  000  000 ) '' .,Republican
in chapter 1 of title iv of the bill  in the item relating to the `` tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund ''  after the first dollar amount  insert `` ( increased by $ 3  000  000 ) '' .,Republican
since the maloney amendment simply transferred $ 3 million from one account to another  thereby providing aid funding without funding unfpa  i did not oppose the amendment .,Republican
victims of the chinese one-child-per-couple policy have told me horrific stories .,Republican
at one religious freedom meeting in china i asked what the participants knew about forced abortion policies .,Republican
all three women in the group broke down in tears as they shared with me how they all had been forced to have abortions -- one woman talked about how she thought god was going to protect her baby  but she was not able to escape the abortion .,Republican
other women who have gained asylum in the united states because of china 's coercive population control program have told me terrible stories of crippling fines  imprisonment of family members  and destruction of homes and property -- all to force abortion and sterilization upon millions of women .,Republican
according mrs.,Republican
gao xiao duan  a former administrator of a chinese planned birth control office  testified before congress about china 's policies .,Republican
she explained  `` once i found a woman who was nine months pregnant  but did not have a birth-allowed certificate .,Republican
according to the policy  she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery .,Republican
in the operation room i saw how the aborted child 's lips were sucking  how its limbs were stretching .,Republican
a physician injected poison into its skull  and the child died  and it was thrown into the trash can .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
i was a monster in the daytime  injuring others by the chinese communist authorities ' barbaric planned-birth policy  but in the evening  i was like all other women and mothers  enjoying my life with my children .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
to all those injured women  to all those children who were killed  i want to repent and say sincerely that i 'm sorry !,Republican
`` while mrs.,Republican
gao acknowledged her part in these human rights atrocities and courageously told her story  unfpa continues to side with the chinese government .,Republican
since 1979  unfpa has been the chief apologist and cheerleader for china 's coercive one child per couple policy .,Republican
despite numerous credible forced abortion reports from impeccable sources  including human rights organizations like amnesty international  journalists  former chinese population control officials and  above all  from the woman victims themselves  high officials at unfpa always dismiss and explain it all away .,Republican
unfpa has funded  provided crucial technical support and  most importantly  provided cover for massive crimes of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization .,Republican
time and again  high officials of unfpa have defended the indefensible and called voluntary that which is anything but .,Republican
the former executive director of unfpa nafis sadik said  `` china has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy .,Republican
the country could offer its experiences and special expert to help other countries.,Republican
'' on cbs nightwatch she said  `` the unfpa firmly believes  and so does the government of the people 's republic of china  that their program is a totally voluntary program.,Republican
'' and sven burmester  unfpa 's man in beijing  gushed over china 's achievements  `` in strictly quantitative terms  it was the most successful family-planning policy ever developed.,Republican
'' make no mistake that china covets unfpa financial and verbal support of their program as a `` good-housekeeping seal of approval '' to whitewash their human rights violations .,Republican
i traveled to china and met with the head of their population control program  peng peiyun .,Republican
in our lengthy conversation  madame peng peiyun told me over and over again that there was no coercion in china  and then she cited unfpa 's participation in the program and unfpa 's public statements where unfpa leaders have defended it .,Republican
the united states should not help unfpa cover up china 's crimes against women and children .,Republican
in 2001  the department of state determined that unfpa 's activities in china violated our human rights law  thereby making them ineligible for u.s. funding .,Republican
on july 21  2001  secretary of state powell wrote  `` regrettably  the prc has in place a regime of severe penalties on women who have unapproved births .,Republican
this regime plainly operates to coerce pregnant women to have abortions in order to avoid the penalties and therefore amounts to a `program of coercive abortion.,Republican
' .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
unfpa 's support of  and involvement in  china 's population-planning activities allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion .,Republican
therefore  it is not permissible to continue funding unfpa at this time.,Republican
'' the funds that would have gone to unfpa were instead given to aid organizations .,Republican
in 2002  china explicitly stated its draconian population control program in law  but unfpa still continues to support the chinese program .,Republican
the bush administration has consistently found unfpa ineligible to receive funding  most recently releasing a july 15  2004 letter where secretary powell said  `` china continues to employ coercion in its birth planning program  including through severe penalties for `out of plan births ' .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
unfpa continues its support and involvement in china 's coercive birth limitation program in counties where china 's restrictive law and penalties are enforced by government officials.,Republican
'' unfpa remains guilty of shamelessly supporting and whitewashing terrible crimes against humanity  and the united states must have no part in subsidizing them .,Republican
in refusing to fund unfpa  president bush and this congress have taken the side of the oppressed and have refused to cooperate with the oppressor .,Republican
unfpa has aggressively defended a barbaric policy that makes brothers and sisters illegal  and makes women the pawns of the population control cadres .,Republican
if unfpa lobbied the chinese government to stop forced abortion as aggressively as they lobby the united states to overturn human rights policy  there would be less suffering in china today .,Republican
an organization like the unfpa that continues to support china 's one-child per couple coerced abortion policy should not be rewarded with any new funding  and the maloney amendment provides them no new funding .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. chairman  this bill is the first step back on the long road to real homeland security .,Republican
first  this bill prevents terrorists and others from getting driver 's licenses by requiring applicants to prove that they are in the country legally .,Republican
driver 's licenses can be used to board an aircraft  open a bank account and get a job .,Republican
to preserve our security  we must deny terrorists the ability to obtain this form of identification .,Republican
in addition  this legislation makes it harder for terrorists to exploit our asylum system .,Republican
it also requires the completion of the 14-mile san diego border fence  which congress approved in 1996 .,Republican
finally  mr.,Republican
chairman  this legislation strengthens our ability to deport terrorists .,Republican
current law makes terrorists inadmissible for certain offenses but not deportable for those same offenses .,Republican
congress can improve homeland security by passing this legislation .,Republican
but if the administration wants to continue to protect the lives of americans  it can also take immediate steps to change policies that have encouraged illegal immigration .,Republican
it should start by requesting funding for all of the border enforcement positions that congress authorized last year .,Republican
the president 's budget only requests enough funds for 210 new border patrol agents  even though congress authorized 2  000 new agents .,Republican
further  the administration must start fining employers for hiring illegal immigrants .,Republican
last year it did not fine a single employer .,Republican
the administration also should change its policy of recognizing consular identification cards issued by other countries .,Republican
these cards are simply not secure or reliable .,Republican
they give terrorists and illegal aliens another way to remain undetected in the united states .,Republican
mr. chairman  the real id act marks the beginning of an effort to make america safer .,Republican
i hope the administration will fully support us in this effort .,Republican
mr. chairman  i strongly support the sessions amendment .,Republican
this amendment helps ensure that deportable aliens are actually removed from the united states .,Republican
incredibly  only 13 percent of the illegal aliens arrested and ordered deported are actually removed from the country .,Republican
illegal aliens trying to sneak across the borders realize that  even if they get caught  they likely will never be required to leave .,Republican
of course  this only encourages illegal immigration .,Republican
the sessions amendment helps correct this problem by giving the department of homeland security guidance on the use of delivery bonds .,Republican
delivery bonds are already authorized under current law .,Republican
this is nothing new .,Republican
they require aliens to post a cash deposit and provide a written commitment they will appear in court .,Republican
if the alien who posts bond violates any conditions of the bond  the bonding agent can take the alien into custody and surrender him to the department of homeland security .,Republican
the sessions amendment improves the use of delivery bonds by setting up 10 turn-in centers around the country to help bonding agents turn over deportable aliens to the department of homeland security .,Republican
it also sets up a system to encourage bonding agents to keep looking for deportable aliens and turn them into dhs when they are found .,Republican
illegal aliens  who comprise over 20 percent of all federal prisoners today  are a serious problem in the united states and pose  obviously  a homeland security threat .,Republican
we need to make sure that aliens who are deported by a court of law are in fact removed from the country .,Republican
the sessions amendment helps make sure that happens .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  and i rise in strong support both of this rule and the underlying bill  the real id act .,Republican
i also want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his effort in bringing this legislation to the floor .,Republican
all of the reforms contained in the real id act are crucial to our national security interests  and all of them will help make america less vulnerable to terrorist attack .,Republican
the bill 's provisions include long-overdue and very common-sense safeguards that were recommended specifically by the 9/11 commission .,Republican
let me point out just one of those .,Republican
`` secure identification should begin in the united states  '' wrote the bipartisan 9/11 commission .,Republican
they went on to say  `` the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification  such as driver 's licenses .,Republican
fraud in identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft .,Republican
at many entry points to vulnerable facilities  including gates for boarding aircraft  sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists.,Republican
'' the bipartisan 9-11 commission called for this legislation .,Republican
just a moment ago i heard one of my colleagues say this legislation does not improve upon the bill we passed dealing with the issue just a few months ago .,Republican
i beg to disagree .,Republican
her point was  it does not address the issue of those who are here illegally  yet it very much does so .,Republican
a provision of this bill pushed by my colleague  the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
flake ) xz4001340  for a number of years  provides that a driver 's license may not have an expiration date beyond the date upon which someone 's visa expires .,Republican
that would specifically go to people here illegally .,Republican
let me point out how it would have applied to the 9/11 hijackers .,Republican
looking at nawaf alhazmi  his visa expired in january of 2001  yet he got a florida 's driver 's license in june of 2001  he got a virginia id card in august of 2001  and he got a reissued virginia id card in september of 2001 .,Republican
a second hijacker  hani hanjour was in the same situation .,Republican
he was in violation of his visa when he obtained a virginia state id in august of 2001 and a maryland id in september of 2001 .,Republican
these are critical reforms to making america safer .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote for both the rule and the underlying legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i strongly oppose the nadler amendment  which would strip the asylum reforms from the `` real id act.,Republican
'' the asylum provisions in the real id act are essential .,Republican
the 9/11 commission specifically noted that `` a number of terrorists .,Republican
.,Republican
.,Republican
abused the asylum system.,Republican
'' just last year  a pakistani national who had applied for asylum was caught while planning to blow up a subway station during the republican convention in new york city .,Republican
under a 9th circuit decision  a judge can determine that an asylum applicant is lying and still be required to grant the applicant admission .,Republican
the doj inspector general reported that it was common for asylum applicants to make claims that they were falsely accused of being terrorists .,Republican
in this situation  even if the judge believes that the applicant is lying and is a terrorist  the judge may still be required to approve the application .,Republican
the real id act reverses this 9th circuit decision and makes it harder for terrorists to exploit our asylum system .,Republican
it allows immigration judges -- like judges in most other courts -- to determine whether the asylum seeker is telling the truth .,Republican
judges in ordinary criminal courts of law are routinely allowed to determine whether they believe a defendant is lying .,Republican
yet  under current law  immigration judges can not make this common sense determination .,Republican
the real id act is essential in stopping asylum abuse .,Republican
this amendment would strike the asylum reform provisions and make it easier for suspected terrorists to receive asylum .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in strong support of the emergency wartime supplemental  especially the provision that would postpone reducing the number of navy aircraft carriers from 12 to 11 .,Republican
our nation is at war against global terrorism and reducing the number of aircraft carriers would be a huge blow to our nation 's defense at this very critical time .,Republican
since the end of the cold war  carriers have been kept very busy and have proven their value in numerous operations .,Republican
in this era of uncertain u.s. access to overseas air bases  the value of carriers as sovereign u.s. bases that can operate in international waters  free from political constraints  is particularly significant .,Republican
during the past half century  the carrier force has never dropped below 12 ships  illustrating the enduring need for a force of at least that many ships .,Republican
after experimenting with an `` 11 + 1 '' carrier force in fy1995-fy2000  dod returned to a force of 12 fully active carriers  suggesting that dod was dissatisfied with a force of less than 12 fully active carriers .,Republican
this provision in the supplemental would effectively delay the decommissioning of the uss kennedy until 6 months after the quadrennial defense review is released .,Republican
the kennedy is based at the mayport naval station near jacksonville  florida .,Republican
aside from concerns of this move striking a blow to national security  the carrier 's retirement would mean an estimated loss of $ 300 million a year to the local economy .,Republican
furthermore  if the kennedy were retired  all of the atlantic fleet 's carriers would be  for some time at least  home ported in a single location .,Republican
this  of course  would not be in the best interest of national security .,Republican
decommissioning the kennedy before the qdr is complete could prove to be a very costly and ill-timed decision .,Republican
the qdr may conclude that a fleet of 12 aircraft carriers is essential to our nation  thus necessitating that the uss kennedy be operational .,Republican
in a time of war  it is unwise to retire an aircraft carrier without knowing whether or not it will be needed .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge members of congress to carefully examine the effects that retiring the kennedy and reducing the number of carriers would not only have on our nation  but the world at large .,Republican
please join me in supporting the supplemental and the provision that keeps the number of carriers in the navy 's fleet contained therein .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of this rule and h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
the 9/11 commission report stated that the abuse of the immigration system and a lack of interior immigration enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activity .,Republican
this bill will establish common-sense requirements for proof of identification for all driver 's licenses and state-issued identification cards .,Republican
this would stop the abuse of our asylum system by terrorist aliens and finish construction of a border fence that will secure one of the most trafficked corridors for illegal aliens and safeguard the united states naval base in san diego  california .,Republican
we know that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some type of u.s. identification documents .,Republican
in fact  the 19 hijackers had 63 driver 's licenses among them .,Republican
these licenses assisted the terrorists in boarding commercial flights  renting cars and other activities necessary to carry out their horrible plans .,Republican
this legislation ensures that terrorists will not be able to game our system any longer and we can not allow mass murderers into our country any longer .,Republican
mr. speaker  according to the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agency  more than 3 million illegal aliens came across our border last year  and i bet probably more than that .,Republican
we have no idea where they are or where they are from .,Republican
however we do know that during the 9-month period from october  2003  through june  2004  over 44  000 non-mexican aliens were caught trying to cross the northern and southern u.s. borders .,Republican
among these aliens  several hundred were from the mideast countries unfriendly to the united states .,Republican
without this legislation  many more will come ; and this is a risk we can not afford to take .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in favor of the rule and in support of the underlying bill  the real id act .,Republican
this is probably one of the most important bills that we will have to vote on in the 109th congress .,Republican
the bill obviously will strengthen our borders  improve the rule of law  and protect our national security .,Republican
it builds upon the recommendations of the 9/11 commission .,Republican
these are things they have talked about and had recommended  and it begins to respond to the pleas of the many families who lost loved ones on that terrible day .,Republican
it implements much needed driver 's license reform .,Republican
now  driver 's licenses have become the primary id in the united states .,Republican
it enables individuals to go get other identity documents  to transfer funds to u.s. bank accounts  obtain access to federal buildings and other vulnerable facilities  purchase a firearm  rent a car  board a plane  et cetera .,Republican
so lax standards and loopholes in the current issue process allow terrorists to obtain driver 's licenses  often multiple licenses from different states  and abuse the license for identification purposes .,Republican
the real id act corrects this .,Republican
identification documents are the last opportunity to ensure that the people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists .,Republican
the real id act would require applicants to provide proof that they are in this country legally .,Republican
currently  11 states do not have such a requirement  meaning the majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter requirements and standards  but unnecessary and dangerous gaps still exist in this system .,Republican
so that is why we need this .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the rule and the bill .,Republican
madam chairman  my amendment would strike all of the taxpayer funded relief provided in the bill to the countries affected by the indian ocean tsunami .,Republican
after reviewing information from the center on philanthropy at indiana university detailing the level of private american contributions to the tsunami relief  i am not sure we need to spend extra taxpayer dollars for that purpose .,Republican
already some 130 private organizations are providing tsunami relief .,Republican
several private companies are also providing relief through their local offices in the region .,Republican
according to the report  some $ 800 million has already been provided by these organizations in cash .,Republican
in addition  another $ 101 million has been provided in kind donations .,Republican
that brings the total to $ 1 billion already  close to $ 1 billion  and that total does not include all the person-to-person aid that is not accounted for in the study .,Republican
since the disaster many americans have looked into their hearts and reached into their wallets in an effort to help alleviate the suffering in thailand  indonesia  sri lanka  and other affected nations .,Republican
one of these companies  as a matter of fact  a company called ch2m hill  was one of the first on the scene to provide critical services to victims ever since .,Republican
they partnered with other countries to provide a clean drinking water purification system to people in indonesia .,Republican
the quality of the water is equivalent to bottled water and is currently being provided throughout the country  including to the u.n .,Republican
compound and more than 10 refugee camps .,Republican
the system is currently purifying water at the rate of 600 gallons per minute  producing 864  000 gallons of purified water each day  helping nearly a quarter of a million people each day .,Republican
i am proud of the efforts of ch2m hill .,Republican
i am proud of all of the americans who have given so much to alleviate the suffering .,Republican
their efforts and indeed all of the efforts are to be commended .,Republican
they help demonstrate that the strength of america 's compassion is best measured by the efforts of individual citizens and private organizations and companies  not by the number of government programs we create or the amount of federal appropriations we dole out .,Republican
given this era of tight budgets and the need to provide for disasters here at home like the hurricanes that ravaged florida  wildfires that burned through the west  tornados that hit middle america  we simply can not ask americans to be all things to all people .,Republican
people have already donated what they can .,Republican
we should not exact further tax dollars from them for this purpose .,Republican
madam chairman  i do not approach this in a light or frivolous way .,Republican
i believe that the issues are significant and serious .,Republican
i believe that  in fact  if more money is needed  we need to do it as a result of a study and careful examination of exactly what needs are still out there .,Republican
recent reports have indicated that in fact ngos are saying that there is more money than they can even deal with .,Republican
some of the ngos have indicated that people are running into each other essentially .,Republican
too many people  too much money flooding the country at the present time .,Republican
if more money is needed  i suggest it be provided in a later appropriation under a regular rule .,Republican
i do not believe that any longer we can consider it to be `` an emergency '' and i certainly do not think that it qualifies for a categorization under this supplemental .,Republican
i have no illusions about the possibility of the passage of this amendment .,Republican
i know it will probably fail and probably fail pretty dramatically .,Republican
i recognize that entirely .,Republican
but i do feel it is important to at least bring to the attention of my colleagues and to the nation that i think a great deal has been done .,Republican
i am proud of every single american who has donated .,Republican
it does come from their heart .,Republican
that is the way we should provide for these things .,Republican
that is not the way this bill intends to do it .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
kind ) xz4002180 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself 2 1/2 minutes .,Republican
mr. chairman  i offer this amendment with the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs.,Republican
myrick ) xz4002880 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
kind ) xz4002180 in a bipartisan amendment for two main reasons : the first is cost .,Republican
what this amendment does  it says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used for embassy security  construction and maintenance .,Republican
in essence it is about a $ 592 million savings amendment .,Republican
i would note in a crs document printed a couple of weeks ago  it states that the state department has identified $ 990 million thus far for the new embassy in baghdad .,Republican
fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 supplementals provided $ 35 million from the state 's diplomatic and consular program account  another $ 105 million came from the fourth quarter fiscal year 2004 coalition provisional authority appropriations  and another $ 184 million of the iraqi relief and reconstruction funds was designated for the embassy .,Republican
this bill provides yet another some $ 590 million for this building .,Republican
the second reason that i support the amendment and oppose this provision in the bill is that we knew years ago that we were going to need a new embassy  and yet last summer when plans were laid for construction of this particular site it was not included in the omnibus appropriation bill taken up in november .,Republican
the 2006 budget request which came up in february  no moneys were included in the president 's budget request for that as well .,Republican
i would note that the national taxpayers union supports this amendment .,Republican
i would also note that time and time again i supported more support for our troops  body armor  supported the president 's request  but this embassy stuck into this bill with this process is not right .,Republican
we need regular order and that is why the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs.,Republican
myrick ) xz4002880 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
kind ) xz4002180 and i are offering this amendment on a bipartisan basis .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this most important issue affecting our country .,Republican
i am a cosponsor of the real id act that calls for necessary reforms in our driver 's license processes to make it harder for terrorists to obtain driver 's license to use them for acts of violence in our country .,Republican
driver 's licenses can be used by terrorists to enter buildings  obtain other forms of identification  and board flights .,Republican
the loopholes that currently exist in issuing driver 's licenses have to be closed to stop those who would use driver 's licenses as a tool in committing terrorist acts on our own soil .,Republican
in fact  as we have heard  we know that many of the hijackers who attacked our nation on september 11 possessed valid driver 's licenses and many other state-issued identity cards .,Republican
the real id act would require applicants to prove that they are in this country legally .,Republican
the debate here somewhat surprises me because i bet if you asked the american people if in order to get a driver 's license  if you have to prove that you are in this country legally  overwhelmingly i believe the people in this country would believe that not only is it the right thing to do but they would be surprised to find out that it is not already a requirement .,Republican
the 9/11 commission stated that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of u.s. identification  and that for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons .,Republican
and their recommendation stated secure identification should begin in the united states .,Republican
the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses .,Republican
last year as we heard the steady beat to implement the 9/11 commission recommendations  certainly  their recommendation that the federal government have standards for driver 's licenses is something that we ought to enact  and i support this bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs.,Republican
myrick ) xz4002880  a coauthor of the amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
i thank my coauthors  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
kind ) xz4002180 and the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs.,Republican
myrick ) xz4002880 .,Republican
i want to say it is not an easy task taking on the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) xz4002391 .,Republican
i too would like to say i am voting for final passage of the supplemental .,Republican
it is important that we have adequate resources for all of our troops .,Republican
i have been to iraq twice .,Republican
i have been to the current embassy in baghdad twice as well .,Republican
i have seen the improvements .,Republican
we have spent something like $ 100 million already trying to make that facility safe .,Republican
it is within the green zone .,Republican
this new embassy where they want to build is just down the river .,Republican
frankly  i would have preferred to see it go where camp victory is .,Republican
i asked that question  in fact  yesterday .,Republican
i was not very pleased with the answer that i got  but maybe in a few more months we will get it right and put it someplace that would be truly safe for all of our folks that are there .,Republican
at the end of the day  those are the questions that all of us should be asking .,Republican
whether it be in an authorization bill that came through this congress the last year or in the omnibus bill or in the president 's budget for fiscal year 2006  this bill no matter what train track it is on will not get to the president until may .,Republican
we ought to take the time to do this right  to ask the right questions and to make sure that all of our people  whether they work for the state department or whether they work for the armed services  have the right resources ; but it ought to go the regular order .,Republican
that is the way this house ought to operate .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i thank the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs.,Republican
kelly ) xz4002130 .,Republican
the gentlewoman is right  charles taylor has been responsible for having dealings with al qaeda and conflict diamonds .,Republican
charles taylor was the one responsible for cutting off arms and legs of young people in sierra leone and in liberia .,Republican
i think the gentlewoman is right  nigeria should return charles taylor so he can have a fair trial .,Republican
i think the administration has a moral obligation to ask the nigerians and get him back to go before the court .,Republican
mr. chairman  i demand a recorded vote .,Republican
mr. chairman  the bill we bring to the floor today includes $ 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science  state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq .,Republican
there are two major issues that i want to summarize  because there is not a lot of time .,Republican
the embassy in iraq .,Republican
the embassy in iraq  45 people have died in attacks on the embassy in iraq .,Republican
we want security in this building ; we want security in many other buildings around the city .,Republican
this embassy will cost less in many respects than many of the other buildings .,Republican
so there is going to be a lot to talk about .,Republican
but to send our men and women in harm 's way to live in a building that is unsafe or to delay the construction would be  quite frankly  wrong .,Republican
on the whole issue of peacekeeping  there may very well be an amendment to strike the peacekeeping section .,Republican
members should know that in the north-south war  2.1 million people in sudan  many christians  some muslims and animists  died in the north-south issue .,Republican
darfur is the scene of genocide today as we now speak  and every member of this house voted to say there was genocide in sudan  and every member of the senate voted the same way .,Republican
to take away the peacekeeping money after the bush administration has done such a good job of bringing north-south peace  to take that away to allow the raping and the pillaging and everything that is going on in sudan would be morally unacceptable .,Republican
now  president bush  working with secretary powell and senator danforth  has negotiated  after 20 years  and keep in mind  osama bin laden lived in sudan from 1991 to 1996  have negotiated for 20 years  and now to strike the peacekeeping money that will send troops in that regard  and we do not want to send american troops there  troops that will stop the pillaging and put insulation into the peace agreement that has been signed  and that will put pressure  pressure  on ending the genocide that is taking place in darfur .,Republican
i would beg this congress after the good work of this administration and members on both sides  and almost everybody signed dear colleague letters urging the administration to do more on sudan  they are now doing it .,Republican
keep in mind there was slavery in sudan up until 2 years ago .,Republican
without peacekeepers in sudan  the north-south agreement will break down  2.1 million christians will have died in vain  and many muslims and many animists  and darfur will not come to an end .,Republican
so i beg this institution  when this amendment comes up to strike peacekeeping for this area  do not support it  because if you support it and it carries  the genocide  i can guarantee you  will continue in darfur and the north-south peace agreement will break down and the war will begin .,Republican
and keep in mind  hamas has training camps in khartoum and so does hezbollah .,Republican
the bill we bring to the floor today includes just over $ 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science  state  justice and commerce  including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq .,Republican
for the state department  we have included $ 1.92 billion  a reduction of $ 285 million from the president 's request .,Republican
the bill includes the necessary funds to maintain our diplomatic presence in iraq and afghanistan  and to let our personnel carry out this duties in the safest and most secure manner possible .,Republican
if we are going to conduct diplomacy anywhere  it had better be done  and done right  in iraq and afghanistan .,Republican
these are front lines of our foreign policy  and we neglect them at our peril .,Republican
this bill pays the costs necessary for operations  logistics  and security in those dangerous  but critically important parts of the world .,Republican
this bill also includes $ 592 million to allow state to move out quickly to build a secure compound in baghdad .,Republican
the current facilities are not secure .,Republican
we need to move people out of harm 's way as soon as possible .,Republican
state has secured a 100 acre site  and is ready to begin construction immediately upon receiving the funds in this bill .,Republican
since the bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam  state has delivered many of these secure compounds on time and on budget .,Republican
with this funding they will complete a secure living and working compound within 24 months of enactment .,Republican
the bill also provides $ 580 million  $ 200 million below the president 's request  to pay for the u.s. share of ongoing peacekeeping missions and a new mission for sudan  where the u.s. has been a driving force for a peace agreement .,Republican
we have also included requested funding for the fbi counterterrorism efforts  and for dea counternarcotics efforts in afghanistan .,Republican
finally  the bill includes requested costs of $ 14.5 million to jump-start the improvement of united states tsunami warning capabilities .,Republican
the committee has scrubbed the president 's request and reduced where we thought it made sense to do so .,Republican
the result before you provides funding for important security measures for our diplomatic personnel  and provides for our ongoing commitments in iraq and elsewhere .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in strong support of the conference report to fund urgent supplemental requirements for the military .,Republican
for the state department  we have included just over $ 2 billion  a reduction of $ 199 million from the president 's request .,Republican
the bill includes the necessary funds to maintain our diplomatic presence in iraq and afghanistan  and for allowing our personnel to carry out their duties in the safest and most secure manner .,Republican
iraq and afghanistan are the front lines of our foreign policy .,Republican
this conference report provides the necessary resources for operations  logistics  and security in those dangerous  but critically important  parts of the world .,Republican
there is also $ 592 million to allow state to move quickly to build a secure compound in baghdad and  as the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
blunt ) xz4000340 said  these facilities are not secure now  and they are needed .,Republican
this money will result in the completion of a secure living and working compound facility within 24 months .,Republican
the $ 680 million  $ 100 million below the president 's request  pays for the u.s. share of ongoing peacekeeping missions  including a new mission for sudan  where it is absolutely critical  now that there is a north-south peace .,Republican
and  by sending this mission there  hopefully  it will bring peace to darfur .,Republican
the conference report also includes $ 241.6 million for domestic appropriations to support the war on terror  including fbi counterterrorism efforts and  for dea  a counternarcotics program in afghanistan .,Republican
finally  it includes $ 17.2 million to jump-start the improvement of the united states tsunami warning capabilities on both coasts .,Republican
the conference report before us provides funding for important security measures for our diplomatic personnel  for our ongoing state department and justice department commitments  and i strongly urge support of the conference report .,Republican
mr. chairman  i compliment the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) for having brought this first of many important appropriation bills to the floor .,Republican
he explained the defense part of this bill very well  as well as he should because he has served superbly as chairman of the defense subcommittee for many years .,Republican
our portion of the bill is just a little over $ 73 billion  and it is to provide for the warfighters  to provide the equipment that they need and the protection that they need as they go about carrying out their mission .,Republican
i want to take just a few seconds and comment on the issue that the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) xz4002860 raised because we have worked together on this section of the bill from the very beginning  along with the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910 and the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
skelton ) xz4003770 of the committee on armed services  the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 .,Republican
this is truly a work of bipartisanship .,Republican
but on the subject of accountability  there is no reason that i can think of other than the importance of the legislative branch of government that article i of the constitution establishes the legislative branch of government .,Republican
we have three branches  separate but equal  but right after the preamble the first article is the legislative branch .,Republican
so i do not know whether that means we are a little more equal  but i do know that we control the money .,Republican
and as i have referred to so many times  and i will continue when it is necessary  it says `` no money shall be drawn from the treasury  but in consequence of appropriations made by law.,Republican
'' that means nobody can spend money  federal money  unless we appropriate it .,Republican
but part of that section that does not get referred to very often says in the same sentence  `` and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.,Republican
'' so we think that is just as important  and we  the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) xz4002860  myself  the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
lewis ) xz4002391  the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
obey ) xz4003000 have just recently met with representatives of the defense department .,Republican
the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) xz4002860 and i just recently sent a letter to the secretary of defense outlining our concerns .,Republican
i think we have made that point very well .,Republican
what we do in this supplemental is to provide  as the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) has mentioned  body armor  the uparmored humvees  ammunition  and medical care .,Republican
we provide the soldiers that are fighting in the war with what they need to accomplish their mission and what they need to protect themselves while they are accomplishing their mission .,Republican
and the specific details of the bill have been made available to members if they want to see all of the items that are funded in this bill .,Republican
i would like to make a brief closing statement that if we are going to get our troops out of iraq  and we are  and we want them out as soon as we possibly can  and as difficult as it is to state a specific date  but the way we are going to get our troops out  our exit strategy is to provide training to the iraqis so they can protect themselves from these terrible  violent insurgent terrorists .,Republican
part of the money in this bill goes to do just that  to train the iraqis to protect themselves so that they can have a self-government with some semblance of security .,Republican
so part of the money will allow the iraqis to get the training that they need .,Republican
that is our exit strategy .,Republican
let them take over from the american troops  and our american troops will come home .,Republican
and in the meantime  say a prayer for them  the ones that are over there still .,Republican
they are still in harm 's way .,Republican
they are doing a really great job .,Republican
their attitude is,Republican
mr. chairman  members should ask themselves how would they like if their children  their son  their daughter  or their husband or their wife was in this embassy here .,Republican
now we have talked a lot  and this committee has done a lot on body armor and humvee armor .,Republican
forty-five people have been killed in the embassy in iraq .,Republican
from irvine  california  keith taylor  rocket attack ; tracy hushin  long island  new york  suicide bomber ; leslie davis from magnolia  texas  suicide bomber ; rosharon  texas  suicide bomber ; astoria  oregon  suicide bomber ; chickasaw  alabama  suicide bomber ; myrtle beach  south carolina  near fallujah attack ; cleveland  ohio ; copperas cove  texas ; north branch  minnesota ; south windham  connecticut .,Republican
this embassy was not built to be an embassy .,Republican
this was saddam hussein 's palace .,Republican
it is a symbol of torture .,Republican
it is not to be the symbol of the united states government .,Republican
we need to act quickly .,Republican
we need to act quickly .,Republican
if this amendment  if the upton amendment passes  there will be a 6-month period whereby they will not have the protection .,Republican
i will put this listing out so members can review them .,Republican
fire in a wooded area  electrical fire in saddam hussein 's palace  again the structure was not built for it .,Republican
fire in saddam 's palace  august  2004 .,Republican
i will not mention the woman 's name  blood on the wall of a rocket attack whereby this young woman was killed .,Republican
and here is a picture of two americans killed the day before the iraqi election .,Republican
we have had 1  500 military people die in the war in iraq .,Republican
it is help bringing about freedom .,Republican
it is making a difference in the palestinian area .,Republican
it is making a difference in egypt .,Republican
it is making a difference in lebanon .,Republican
it is inappropriate for us not to fund a safe workplace for american citizens who are going to work in harm 's way .,Republican
lastly  people say this is an expensive embassy .,Republican
this is an embassy  but it is a village .,Republican
there is a power plant .,Republican
there are housing facilities .,Republican
the beijing embassy cost $ 434 million .,Republican
there is no threat to american citizens in beijing .,Republican
there are no terrorist attacks .,Republican
in lebanon  1983  241 marines were killed in a barracks with no setback .,Republican
that same year in the american embassy in lebanon  a number of americans killed .,Republican
there was the american bombing of the embassies in tanzania and kenya 1989 .,Republican
we have a moral obligation to the people that we are sending in this region to live in a situation and work where they will be protected .,Republican
i rise in strong opposition to this amendment .,Republican
as the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
cunningham ) xz4000910 said as i was walking down to the well  how would members like it if your children  your son or daughter or husband or wife had to work in this facility .,Republican
i urge a no vote on the amendment .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time .,Republican
the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha )  the ranking member on our defense subcommittee  has explained the bill quite thoroughly as it relates to the war fighters .,Republican
the biggest part of this supplemental is for war fighters  and the bill that we have put together goes just to that issue .,Republican
the increases that we have added in this bill go to the urgently needed items such as ammunition  weapons  up-armored humvees  transport vehicles  jammers  night vision equipment  radios  add-on armor kits ; and the list goes on and on .,Republican
and i include a list of those items that are for the war fighter and force protection  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) and the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and i and many of our colleagues have visited our hospitals to visit with our soldiers and marines at walter reed and at bethesda naval hospital and also at landstuhl  where many of our servicemen come first before they get transported back to the united states  and we have located a number of areas where the government just does not take care of these soldiers and the marines .,Republican
and this bill goes a long way towards taking care of that .,Republican
it has been pretty generally known that we have in this bill increased the death benefit for those who make the total sacrifice and lose their lives in working and supporting the nation 's security .,Republican
we have also increased the service group life insurance programs substantially so that those who prefer to take part in that program can have additional benefits  and many of these benefits are really needed .,Republican
and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr.,Republican
murtha ) referred to this  but i want to take just a minute and explain .,Republican
we added  basically  a new program  and that is for a traumatic injury insurance benefit for members of the service .,Republican
we provide up to $ 100  000 to compensate for injuries such as loss of sight  losing a hand or a foot  or other debilitating injuries .,Republican
and these benefits would be retroactive to october of 2001  when the war started .,Republican
there are many soldiers and marines today who have been wounded so seriously that in previous wars would have died on the battlefield but who are living today in this war because of improved and increased medical benefits and better training and better medicines and the ability to transport from the battlefield to a medical facility .,Republican
so these soldiers and marines are hurt really bad  and we have an obligation to take care of them  and this bill goes a long way toward beginning that process  to take care of things for our heroes and our fallen heroes who have not been taken care of by the government properly .,Republican
the material previously referred to is as follows : conference agreement for additional equipment missile procurement  army : itas/tow mods 30  000 procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles  army : bradley reactive armor tiles 20  000 stryker 69  540 small arms modifications 55  200 procurement of ammunition  army : ammunition industrial base 57  800 other procurement  army : up-armored idmwvs ( m1114 ) 150  000 other hmmwvs ( m1151 ) 80  000 225  000 114  000 add-on armor kits 48  000 sincgars family 30  000 improved hf radios ( including prc-150 and prc-148 ) 17  000 jammers ( warlock including low cost jammer ) 60  000 night vision devices 59  000 counter rocket artillery and mortar system ( cram ) 75  000 force xxi battle command brigade and below ( fbcb2 ) 66  100 handheld stand-off mine detection system ( hstamids ) 10  000 & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; army total : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; 1  166  640 procurement of ammunition  navy and marine corps : small arms ammunition 6  000 procurement  marine corps : light armored vehicle ( lav ) 175  000 night vision equipment 54  000 radio systems ( including eplrs  prc-117 and hf communications vehicle ) 55  000 hmmwvs 30  000 & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; marine corps total : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; 320  000 grand total : 1  486  640 & lt ; p & gt ;,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of h.r.,Republican
418  the real id act of 2005 .,Republican
first  i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner and the judiciary committee for their leadership on this bill  and for their dedication to securing our borders and protecting americans from terrorists .,Republican
my objective throughout debate over h.r.,Republican
10 was to get a bill that fully addressed all of our nation 's security concerns .,Republican
that means not only reforming how we gather and use intelligence  but also how we fight terrorism at home .,Republican
i believe that the final bill that came to the floor fell short .,Republican
that 's why i voted against it .,Republican
however  the real id act implements crucial provisions that were dropped from h.r.,Republican
10 and fixes several glaring holes in our border security .,Republican
one of the most important provisions in this legislation asks states to work with the department of homeland security to establish and use standards for drivers ' licenses .,Republican
many states already have licenses that are difficult to counterfeit .,Republican
other states do n't have stringent safeguards .,Republican
some have argued that this bill creates a national id .,Republican
it does n't .,Republican
i would oppose any bill that did so .,Republican
this bill simply requires states to make it harder for someone like muhammad atta to get a driver 's license  and to use that license to carry out terror plans .,Republican
as the 9/11 commission noted : `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of u.s. identification document  some by fraud.,Republican
'' increased id security will make it more difficult for terrorists to obtain documents through fraud and conceal their identity .,Republican
deterring terrorists from receiving state issued ids will make it more likely that they will be detected by law enforcement .,Republican
this bill also tightens our asylum system -- a system that has been abused by terrorists with deadly consequences -- by allowing judges to determine whether asylum seekers are truthful .,Republican
additionally  the bill will protect the american people by ensuring that grounds for keeping a terrorist out of the country are also grounds for deportation .,Republican
incredibly  we have legal justification to prevent an individual from entering the country if they have known terrorist ties  however  under current u.s. law once they set foot inside the border we can not deport them .,Republican
this hinders our ability to protect americans from foreign terrorists who have infiltrated the united states .,Republican
i think all americans -- and those of us on both sides of the aisle -- can agree that the 9/11 commission identified a number of improvements that will help upgrade our intelligence and enhance america 's security .,Republican
this bill provides common sense provisions to help prevent another 9/11-type attack by protecting our borders and disrupting terrorist travel in the united states .,Republican
i urge members to vote in favor of the real id act .,Republican
i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
sessions ) for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i do rise to address support for the rule and the underlying legislation and  specifically  a few of the allegations that have been made about this legislation .,Republican
first of all  there has been an allegation made that this violates states ' rights .,Republican
many of us are firm believers and supporters of states ' rights  and the fact is  the states have the right to give a driver 's license to whomever they wish .,Republican
that is their state 's right .,Republican
however  this legislation says  if you are going to use that identification card to get on transportation that is in interstate commerce or otherwise  then it is going to have to meet certain minimum standards .,Republican
so you have the states ' rights .,Republican
however  this federal government has the obligation to protect its citizens  and it is something that should not and will not be taken lightly .,Republican
as regards another aspect  asylum  we have a situation in which a legislative body  as it has come to be  that is also known as the ninth circuit court of appeals  has enacted legislation that overcomes and overwhelms a judge 's right and ability to judge credibility as it should .,Republican
that has to be overcome by this legislative body  trumping that legislative body called the ninth circuit .,Republican
that is what we are trying to do .,Republican
i have heard friends across the aisle say that americans have journeyed freely in the past and that this goes against the very freedoms which this nation was founded on .,Republican
but the truth is  try getting on an airplane .,Republican
we do not have freedom anymore .,Republican
and the more liberties that we forgo withdrawing at the border  and restricting and making sure people who are coming in do not mean us harm  then the more liberties we are going to lose in this country .,Republican
so it is important that we make sure we have that water metaphorically flowing into this lake to give it life  but it is even more important that we restrict those who would harm us from coming in  as they would .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
1268  the emergency supplemental and wartime appropriations act of 2005 .,Republican
this supplemental provides necessary funding for a variety of military operations and for equipment that will keep our troops safe while they fight the war on terror .,Republican
we are asking the brave men and women of our armed forces to put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom .,Republican
in return  we should not hesitate to give them the best protective gear that we can provide .,Republican
however  i have serious concerns about providing additional non-defense and nonemergency items  such as money for facility construction and international peacekeeping efforts that are included in this supplemental .,Republican
i believe that while these items may be vital to our nation 's interests  they are not true emergencies .,Republican
i commend the chairman of the appropriations committee  the distinguished gentleman from california  mr.,Republican
lewis  for his efforts to limit the amount of non-defense and nonemergency funding in this bill .,Republican
but  far too often the federal government deems additional spending an `` emergency '' because it was not included in the original budget request .,Republican
any non-defense and non-emergency funding should be considered in the regular budget process .,Republican
as members of congress  we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure any new request for emergency spending is thoroughly reviewed and considered in a fair manner on the house floor  especially when essential funding for our nation 's armed forces is at stake .,Republican
despite my displeasure in allowing some of these additional items to be included in the supplemental  i support this legislation because congress has a moral obligation to provide our troops with the safest equipment and most up to date training available .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today to voice my strong support for the real id act  particularly its provisions calling for stronger standards for obtaining driver 's licenses .,Republican
page 47 of the 9/11 commission report  `` without freedom of movement  terrorists can not plan  conduct surveillance  hold meetings  train for their mission or execute an attack.,Republican
'' others have argued that the proposal involves an unprecedented preemption of state authority regarding the issuance and production of driver 's licenses .,Republican
this is untrue .,Republican
let me be clear : we are not preempting state authority in this area .,Republican
what we are doing is establishing minimum standards for federal acceptance of such documents .,Republican
this is consistent with actions taken by individual states .,Republican
today  nevada and new mexico do not accept as proof of identity a state-issued driver 's license or identification card from states that do not meet their standards .,Republican
the federalism issue is one of extreme importance  and that is exactly why the language has been crafted as it has .,Republican
driver 's licenses have become the primary form of identification in the united states .,Republican
they permit people to apply for other forms of identification  transfer funds to bank accounts  obtain access to federal buildings  purchase firearms and board airplanes .,Republican
the majority of the states have recognized the privilege that a license brings and have set high standards for obtaining them .,Republican
however  10 states  including my state of north carolina  issue valid driver 's licenses and identification cards without requiring proof of legal status .,Republican
that is scary .,Republican
according to the 9/11 commission report  these travel documents are just as important as weapons are to terrorists .,Republican
the real id act would require that federal agencies accept only driver 's licenses and state-issued identification cards from states that prove the legal status of applicants .,Republican
the bill would also require states to review the legality of existing license holders upon renewal or replacement .,Republican
the bill does not seek to set state policy for who may or who may not drive a car .,Republican
it aims to set rigorous standards for what may be used as a form of id to a federal official .,Republican
as i have stated before  i am a strong advocate of states ' rights .,Republican
however  if certain states act irresponsibly and place the national security of the rest of the country at risk  then congress must get involved .,Republican
we must do what it takes to make america safe .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
418 .,Republican
twenty-six years ago  when i first came to this chamber  we were speaking about border security .,Republican
sixteen years ago  when i left this chamber  we were speaking about border security ; and here we are again .,Republican
a fundamental aspect of national sovereignty is that a nation is able to control its own borders .,Republican
the nature of this requirement is of particular importance in the post-9/11 environment in which we must all live .,Republican
in years past  when those of us on the subcommittee on immigration confronted this challenge  there were traffickers and human cargo and narcotics and the increasing problem of criminal gangs who profit from such enterprises .,Republican
today  however  we must deal with the additional worry that these channels of illicit commerce may also include those who enter our country to kill innocent americans and the related concerns of weapons of mass destruction .,Republican
the real id act  introduced by the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner )  is an important step in meeting this challenge .,Republican
in conjunction with the additional border patrol positions authorized by this body at the close of the last congress  h.r.,Republican
418 will remove the impediments to completing the fence along the san diego corridor of our southern border .,Republican
i want to commend my predecessor in the third congressional district in california  mr.,Republican
doug ose  who worked hard to remove the regulatory obstacles to completion of the fence .,Republican
in today 's post-9/11 environment  it is one component in an integrated u.s. border security system .,Republican
there is simply no excuse for the failure to complete the remaining 3 1/2 miles of the security fence .,Republican
the language offered by our colleague from wisconsin would allow us to do so .,Republican
in our system of governance  the united states government and specifically the congress have given us what is tantamount to plenary jurisdiction over immigration law .,Republican
as a former attorney general in my state  i can make the observation that in most areas of the law enforcement  the states and local governments have primary jurisdiction .,Republican
that is not the case with immigration enforcement .,Republican
as a former president of the other party put it in a different context  `` the buck stops here.,Republican
'' although i am a committed believer in federalism  the nature of the task and the language of article i  section 8  are clear .,Republican
while this bill in no way preempts state law with respect to the issuance of driver 's licenses  it does entail a modest notion that the immigration laws enacted by this body ought to mean something .,Republican
mr. speaker  i congratulate the chairman on this bill .,Republican
it is important that we take care of business with our military .,Republican
mr. speaker  having been to iraq this year  i saw our troops  our young men and women from all branches of the service doing the finest job ever representing the concept of freedom and representing the united states ; and they certainly need the supplemental .,Republican
however  i am concerned about some of the baggage that seems to have been added to the supplemental .,Republican
and i think maybe in the future we should be careful about adding things that are not really important emergencies  such as in this supplemental conferring eligibility for rural housing assistance grants in the village of new miami  ohio ; allowing some farm service accounts for the alaska dairy farmers ; increasing the cost of the fort peck fish hatchery project in minnesota ; and adding to the national center for manufacturing services in michigan ; along with $ 500  000 for the oral history of negotiated settlement projects at the university of nevada .,Republican
i think these belong in some other bill .,Republican
they may be great projects  but they certainly are not emergency projects .,Republican
but i do urge all members of the house to support this legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of the amendment by my colleague from delaware .,Republican
this amendment takes a common sense approach in saying that those who want to board our nation 's airplanes must show documentation showing their full legal identity .,Republican
the real id act  which i strongly support  requires that these driver 's licenses must meet tough federal standards  chief among them are the requirements that applicants must demonstrate their legal presence .,Republican
as a member of the aviation subcommittee and as a member from the great state of texas  i strongly feel we need to put just as much of an emphasis on protecting the skies as we do our land borders .,Republican
this amendment would simply require the homeland security department to better track those attempting to conceal their identities before boarding airplanes and allow those officials greater authority to screen these passengers and detect threats before they may occur .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from georgia for providing some of that information .,Republican
it seems that our colleagues probably are so wrong on this bill they can not even talk about it .,Republican
they want to come down here and talk about all sorts of other things that are not involved in class action .,Republican
they are talking about protection .,Republican
well  i would like the american people to know and our colleagues to know we are talking about protection .,Republican
we are talking about protecting americans ' pockets books  because our constituents know somebody is going to pay  and if greedy lawyers are getting big settlements  they are going to be paying more at the cash register every single time they go buy something .,Republican
an entire industry has grown up over attorneys seeking cash in these class-action lawsuits .,Republican
our courts are to be designed for fairness  a forum of fairness and justice  but they have become a virtual atm for greedy lawyers when it comes to class-action lawsuits .,Republican
lawyers go file a class-action lawsuit and collect millions of dollars  just as the gentleman from georgia was saying ; and the clients  who they barely know  most times they have never even met most of these folks  those clients are receiving pennies .,Republican
mr. speaker  my colleague spoke saying this would not help the victims .,Republican
i would like people to know the class action fairness act does not restrict true victims from filing class-action lawsuits .,Republican
it will prevent attorneys from choosing which state to file in  because we know sometimes they choose where they think they can get the biggest monetary award .,Republican
we are putting the focus back on justice  back on justice in this bill .,Republican
in addition  the reform provides greater consumer protection by allowing our courts to scrutinize those settlements that provide victims with coupons while those attorneys are getting millions and millions and millions of dollars .,Republican
mr. speaker  this is an overdue reform .,Republican
we have worked tirelessly on this in the house  and i urge everyone to support it .,Republican
mr. speaker  the vote in this house we will take within the hour will leave only one more step  the president 's signature  in this first major attack on lawsuit abuse .,Republican
i oppose the substitute and support the bill .,Republican
i want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr.,Republican
sensenbrenner ) and his committee and all the members  in fact  who have been willing to take on this tough fight  but particularly to the chairman for working hard to find a way to get this bill on the floor and to the president this early in this congress .,Republican
frivolous lawsuits are clogging america 's judicial system  endangering america 's small businesses  jeopardizing jobs  and driving up prices for consumers .,Republican
the bill we are debating today will reduce these junk lawsuits through tougher sanctions and increased commonsense protections .,Republican
the past few years have witnessed an explosion of interstate class actions being filed in state courts  particularly in certain magnet jurisdictions .,Republican
these magnet courts are filled with class action abuses .,Republican
they routinely approve settlements in which the lawyers receive large fees and the class members receive virtually nothing .,Republican
the class action fairness act is a commonsense bipartisan plan that addresses this serious problem by allowing larger interstate class action cases  cases that truly do involve multiple states  to be filed in federal court .,Republican
in addition to unclogging certain overused courts  this bill ends the harassment of local businesses through forum shopping .,Republican
lawyers who now manipulate this system often do anything to stay out of federal court .,Republican
they sometimes name a local pharmacy or a local convenience store in a nationwide product liability suit simply because they believe that court  and that court often has created a reputation as the place to go to get unjust settlements .,Republican
sometimes they wait and amend their complaint and add millions of dollars of claims after the deadline for removal to federal court .,Republican
this bill stops this unfair practice as well .,Republican
this bill also establishes a much-needed class action rights bill .,Republican
several provisions are specifically designed to ensure that class members  not their attorneys  are the primary beneficiaries of the class action process .,Republican
six years ago on this floor we really began the process of attacking this system .,Republican
the stories go on and on and on  to the point that by the time we passed legislation like this in the last congress for the third congress straight  members were eager to just simply get a couple of minutes to talk about one of the classes where the people in the class get a dollar-off coupon  the people in the class get the smallest possible box of cheerios  the people in the class get a 31-cent check  or the people in the class even wind up having to pay the lawyers of the class additional money because there really was no money for the people in the class that was being determined .,Republican
this bill requires that judges carefully review settlements and limits attorneys fees when the value of the settlement received by the class members is minor in comparison or when there is a net loss settlement where the class members actually end up losing money .,Republican
this bill bans settlements that award some class members a large recovery simply because they live closer to the court that the lawyers shopped for to get that case in that judge 's court .,Republican
it allows federal courts to maximize the benefit of class action settlements by requiring that unclaimed settlement funds be donated to charitable organizations .,Republican
the class action fairness act is good for small business and good for consumers .,Republican
i urge a `` no '' vote on the substitute .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman and his committee for their hard work on this effort .,Republican
mr. speaker  to understand the need for s. 5  we need to understand the game the class action lawyers play here and how they go about abusing the court systems .,Republican
i call it class action monopoly .,Republican
here is how it works .,Republican
they start at go .,Republican
the first thing they do is come up with an idea for a lawsuit .,Republican
and then they find a named plaintiff .,Republican
it does not have to be someone who is actually injured in the process .,Republican
all the lawyer really needs is an idea for a lawsuit and potential defendants who have deep pockets .,Republican
next they find a person who is the named plaintiff .,Republican
that named plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as one of the defendants and that puts them in the state court  which is where they want to be .,Republican
sometimes they have to promise to pay off that named plaintiff at this point  but that is all part of the game .,Republican
next the lawyers level their allegations  both in court and in the media .,Republican
remember  they do not have to have proof for their allegations .,Republican
they just need a forum in which to make the allegations .,Republican
now the real fun begins after you have made the allegations .,Republican
they are in state court with the named plaintiffs and their allegations  and it is time to get out of rule 23 free .,Republican
rule 23 is the rule that would apply in federal courts that defines when a class action can be certified consistent with fundamental fairness and due process considerations .,Republican
but in this game  there is no fairness .,Republican
there is no due process .,Republican
so they easily convince their magnet state to certify that they have a class and at the same time they file copycat lawsuits in state courts all over the country .,Republican
these are the same class actions asserting the same claims on behalf of the same people .,Republican
these copycat lawsuits clog the state courts .,Republican
at this point in the game  the lawyers start making the money .,Republican
let us see where the money goes .,Republican
in the columbia house record case  the lawyers took home $ 5 million and the plaintiffs got a coupon for discounts on future purchases of records .,Republican
in the blockbuster case  the lawyers walked away with $ 9.25 million  and the plaintiffs again got a coupon for $ 1 off their next video rental  coupons that the defendant probably would have issued anyway .,Republican
in the bank of boston case  the lawyers settled the case and took home $ 8.5 million .,Republican
and the customers had money deducted from their mortgage accounts to pay off the lawyers .,Republican
so in the end  a state court approved these cases  and all of the consumers in the lawsuit lost money .,Republican
people may be wondering what happens to them in this game .,Republican
we already know that if one is a consumer  in the consumer class  they will be lucky if they get a dollar-off coupon .,Republican
if the business one works for gets sued in one of the class actions  their employer is going to take a major hit and maybe even lay them off .,Republican
it is that clear in some of these cases  the basic result is that the lawyers will get lots of money  but consumers will pay because health care and car insurance premiums will go through the roof .,Republican
and when the game comes to an end  they are left with no money and the lawyers are at `` go '' and they get to start the process all over again .,Republican
it is fundamentally important that we resolve this problem and help america move forward .,Republican
i urge support of s. 5 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of the class action fairness act because we can not act fast enough .,Republican
we have been trying to act to address the dire needs of our nation 's judicial system .,Republican
today  predatory lawyers take advantage of class action law by shopping for venues where they can find sympathetic judges and juries .,Republican
each time a lawyer goes venue shopping  it costs taxpayers and it costs our economy by bogging down job creators with frivolous and excessive litigation .,Republican
national review magazine has called my home state of west virginia one of the worst states because of its cruel legal climate .,Republican
data and statistics indicate that since 1978  legal costs in west virginia have risen more than 10 times faster than the state economy as a whole .,Republican
as a result  our economy has not grown as fast as the rest of the nation  and the jobs that west virginians seek to support their families are not as readily available as they are in other parts of our country .,Republican
west virginia 's civil justice system has been ranked as one of the worst when it comes to the treatment of class actions .,Republican
as a result of west virginia 's relaxation and less vigorous application of procedural rules  courts are generally viewed by lawyers as more favorable and advantageous to plaintiffs  and accordingly west virginia has become a magnet of mass tort litigation .,Republican
what is very alarming is when a victim receives little or no compensation .,Republican
the class action fairness act aims to curb class settlements that provide significant fees to a lawyer with marginal benefits to victims .,Republican
the class action fairness act takes strong steps to ensure injured consumers recoup real awards from victorious verdicts  rather than settlements that involve coupons  which largely benefit the lawyers .,Republican
the class action fairness act creates important reforms that will reduce lawsuit abuse and protect individuals .,Republican
it is as simple as that .,Republican
i urge support for this legislation  and for the fair and balanced rule before us .,Republican
mr. speaker  it is my honor to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
royce ) xz4003480 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs.,Republican
capito ) xz4000610  my colleague on the committee on rules .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
mcgovern ) xz4002630  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only .,Republican
mr. speaker  house resolution 96 is a structured rule providing 90 minutes of debate for consideration of s. 5  the class action fairness act of 2005 .,Republican
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill  makes in order one amendment in the nature of a substitute  it waives all points of order against this amendment  and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge support for the rule because we have before us a fair rule .,Republican
i could say an excellent rule .,Republican
the previous gentleman from massachusetts was rating these rules .,Republican
but this is fair in both senses of that term  a fair rule that gives members on both sides of the aisle a chance to discuss their ideas on class action reform .,Republican
i believe there is a general consensus that our system for class action litigation is flawed .,Republican
as demonstrated by the other body  there is bipartisan support for the measure that will be coming before us .,Republican
in fact  the other body passed this measure by a vote of 72 to 26 with strong bipartisan support .,Republican
even with that bipartisan support  however  there are differences of opinion on how to reform our class action system .,Republican
this bill through granting consideration of a substitute amendment will allow us to openly discuss these opinions and ideas .,Republican
mr. speaker  our general tort system costs american businesses $ 129 billion each and every year .,Republican
even our smallest companies pay collectively about $ 33 billion a year  or 26 percent of the overall tort costs to businesses borne by our smallest companies .,Republican
class action reform is a first step in litigation reform aimed at providing relief for these small businesses .,Republican
i am pleased that we are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel .,Republican
this chamber has passed class action litigation reform on four previous occasions .,Republican
it is about time that we sent a reform package to the president 's desk for his signature .,Republican
the underlying bill will make several key reforms including expanding federal jurisdiction over large interstate class actions as originally intended by our founding fathers  create exceptions that keep truly local disputes in state courts  provide an end to the harassment of local businesses as part of this forum shopping game  and create a consumer class action bill of rights .,Republican
mr. speaker  i would like to again urge my colleagues to support this rule which passed out of the committee on rules without objection and to vote in favor of the underlying bill which will provide this much needed reform .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 96 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  in response to some of the comments that were made by the gentleman from massachusetts  i want to share with my colleagues some facts .,Republican
the class action fairness act contains several provisions specifically designed to ensure that class members  not their attorneys  class members  not their attorneys  are the primary beneficiaries of the class-action process .,Republican
for example  the act  number one  requires that judges carefully review all coupon settlements and limit attorney 's fees paid in such settlements to the value actually received by the class members .,Republican
second  it requires careful scrutiny of `` net loss '' settlements in which the class members end up losing money .,Republican
thirdly  it bans settlements that award some class members a larger recovery just because they live closer to the court .,Republican
lastly  it allows federal courts to maximize the benefits of class-action settlements by requiring that unclaimed coupons or settlement funds be donated to charitable organizations .,Republican
in addition  the bill would require that notice of proposed settlements be provided to appropriate state and federal officials  such as state attorneys general .,Republican
let me also address one other issue raised  and i think this is very important .,Republican
this myth is being circulated that the class action fairness act would move all or virtually all class actions to federal courts  overwhelming federal judges and denying state courts the ability to resolve local disputes .,Republican
well  a recent study examined class actions in the state courts of connecticut  delaware  maine  massachusetts  new york and rhode island  to determine what effect the bill would have on the class actions filed in those respective states .,Republican
here is what they found in regard to the state of massachusetts .,Republican
sixty-one percent  30 out of 49 of the reported class actions  would have presumedly remained in state court .,Republican
at least 10 of the 19 massachusetts cases that would be affected by this bill  the class action fairness act  involved nationwide classes  cases primarily involving citizens living in other states .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs.,Republican
blackburn ) xz4000320 a former member of the committee on the judiciary and an original cosponsor of this bill in the 108th congress .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
in response to the gentlewoman from texas  the committee on rules has jurisdiction  and anybody that knows the history of this body knows and understands that the committee on rules certainly has jurisdiction .,Republican
let me just give a little history for my colleagues and particularly for the gentlewoman from texas in regard to this bill .,Republican
again  in the 105th congress  senate bill 2083  the class action fairness act  senate held hearing  reported by subcommittee .,Republican
house resolution 3789  class action jurisdiction act of 1998  committee hearing and markup held  reported from the house committee on the judiciary  17 to 12 .,Republican
mr. speaker  in the 106th congress  h.r.,Republican
1875  interstate class action jurisdiction act of 1999 .,Republican
committee hearing and markup held  passed floor 222 to 207 .,Republican
in the 107th congress  h.r.,Republican
2341  class action fairness act of 2001 .,Republican
committee hearing and markup held ; passed floor  233 to 190 .,Republican
in the 108th congress  h.r.,Republican
1115  class action fairness act of 2003  committee hearing and markup held  passed floor  253 to 170 .,Republican
no hearings ?,Republican
indeed .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i want to address the remarks of the gentlewoman from texas .,Republican
i want to remind her that the committee on rules voted unanimously in favor of this rule and granted an amendment in order in the form of a substitute that includes each and every one of the provisions that she just spoke of .,Republican
i also would like to remind my colleagues that each and every one of those amendments were also proffered in the other body  and each and every one of those amendments were voted down in a strong bipartisan vote .,Republican
so to suggest  mr.,Republican
speaker  that this is something that had not been looked at and we have not talked about  i would remind my colleague that it was addressed in the 105th congress  in the 106th congress  in the 107th congress  in the 108th congress  and finally we are here  and we are going to get this rule passed and this bill passed and on to the president for his signature .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr.,Republican
cole ) xz4000770  my colleague on the committee on rules .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support today of the real id act .,Republican
as the former chief of counterterrorism in the u.s. department of justice for the western district of texas  i had jurisdiction over the mexican-texas border .,Republican
i dealt  firsthand really  with the day-to-day threats our nation faces  and asked the question  why are we not doing more to secure our borders ?,Republican
many of those intent on doing our nation harm claim political asylum as their trojan horse to gain access to our borders .,Republican
individuals like the 1993 world trade center bomber  ramzi yousef  claimed political asylum and was ordered to appear at a hearing .,Republican
yet yousef  like a majority of those given notices  failed to show up at the hearings .,Republican
this bill will make it easier to deport suspected terrorists .,Republican
terrorists have taken advantage of other holes in our laws .,Republican
the 19 hijackers on september 11th had fraudulently obtained dozens of american visas  passports and driver 's licenses  documents used to open bank accounts  establish residency and  yes  to fly airplanes .,Republican
this border security legislation provides the safety measure that to obtain a driver 's license  the person must simply prove they have a legal right to remain in our nation .,Republican
for the safety and security of our nation  our families and our freedom  i urge my colleagues to support this bill .,Republican
the 9/11 commission recommended it .,Republican
we owe it to the victims of the national tragedy to pass this legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
westmoreland )  the former minority leader of the georgia house of representatives .,Republican
mr. speaker  how much time do i have remaining ?,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  this is a fair rule for legislation that will help restore fairness and common sense to the current class action system .,Republican
like h.r.,Republican
1115  which overwhelmingly passed the house last congress  s. 5 expands federal diversity jurisdiction over interstate class actions in a manner consistent with the framers ' constitutional intent that federal court preside over controversies between citizens of different states .,Republican
s. 5 also protects consumers from these bogus coupon settlements that reward trial lawyers with millions in windfall fees while clients who never hired them get coupons in the mail .,Republican
mr. speaker  i want to call attention to this slide before me .,Republican
this is from the washington post  november of 2002 .,Republican
the washington post is not exactly the most conservative newspaper in the country : `` the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees .,Republican
this is not justice .,Republican
it is an extortion racket that only congress can fix.,Republican
'' the senate 's overwhelming passage of s. 5 by a vote of 72 to 26 just last week reflects a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of reforming a class-action system that is prone to systematic abuse .,Republican
of those 26  18 were democrats  and each one of those provisions in that amendment in the nature of a substitute were offered in the senate  and each one of them were voted down in a bipartisan fashion .,Republican
i think we all  in both the senate and the house  and both republicans and democrats  we want to do the right thing here  and we want to make sure that  as the washington post says  that we eliminate this extortion racket and bring some fairness to this class-action system .,Republican
after all  it is the injured person  it is the plaintiff that deserves a fair and just settlement  and it should not be just a lottery windfall for lawyers who venue shop  looking for places like  and we have heard it during this hour 's discussion  madison county  illinois  the epicenter of this class-action lawsuit abuse .,Republican
what happens in madison county  illinois  affects the whole country .,Republican
so i encourage my colleagues to vote for the rule  vote for s. 5 tomorrow .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the remaining portion of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
mcgovern ) presented that case ; and i want to present the real crux of this problem  and let me read a suit  shields  et al v. bridgestone/firestone  incorporated in texas  a suit in texas .,Republican
this suit involves customers who had firestone tires that were among those that the national highway traffic safety administration investigated or recalled but who did not suffer any personal injury or property damage .,Republican
after a federal appeals court rejected class certification  plaintiffs ' counsel and firestone negotiated a settlement which has now been approved by a texas state court .,Republican
under the settlement  the company has agreed to redesign certain tires  a move that was already underway irrespective of the suit  and to develop a 3-year consumer education and awareness campaign  but the members of the class received nothing .,Republican
the lawyers  they got $ 19 million .,Republican
madam speaker  i would also like to discuss the home state exception in the legislation .,Republican
new subsections 1332 ( d ) ( 3 ) and ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against the defendant in its home state  dividing such cases into three categories .,Republican
first  for cases in which two-thirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed  section 1332 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) states that federal jurisdiction will not be extended by s. 5 .,Republican
such cases will remain in state courts .,Republican
second  cases in which more than two-thirds of the members of the plaintiff class are not citizens of the state in which the action was filed will be subject to federal jurisdiction .,Republican
federal courts should be able to hear such lawsuits because they have a predominantly interstate component .,Republican
they affect people in many jurisdictions  and the laws of many states will be at issue .,Republican
finally  there is a middle category of class actions in which more than one-third  but fewer than two-thirds  of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are all citizens of the state in which the action was filed .,Republican
in such cases  the numbers alone may not always confirm that the litigation is more fairly characterized as predominantly interstate in character .,Republican
new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 3 )  therefore  gives federal courts discretion in the interests of justice to decline to exercise jurisdiction over such cases based on the consideration of five factors .,Republican
madam speaker  i would ask the chairman to explain these factors .,Republican
madam speaker  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
madam speaker  if the chairman would continue to yield .,Republican
i thank the gentleman for yielding .,Republican
finally  mr.,Republican
speaker  some critics have complained that the legislation removal provisions will result in delay .,Republican
can the gentleman explain why that is simply not the case ?,Republican
i thank the chairman for yielding once again .,Republican
madam speaker  in this regard i think it is important to note that the exceptions in this legislation are just that  exceptions  and they should not be interpreted in ways that turn them into loopholes .,Republican
for example  the legislation excludes actions against states .,Republican
obviously  this does not mean that plaintiffs can simply name a state in every consumer class action and stay out of federal court .,Republican
to the contrary  federal courts should proceed cautiously before declining federal jurisdiction under the subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 5 ) ( a ) `` state action '' case exception  and do so only when it is clear that the primary defendants are indeed states  state officials  or other governmental entities against whom the court may be foreclosed from ordering relief .,Republican
the sponsors intend that primary defendants be intended to reach those defendants who are the real targets of the lawsuit  i.e .,Republican
the defendants who would be expected to incur most of the loss if liability is found .,Republican
thus  the term `` primary defendant '' should include any person who has substantial exposure to significant portions of the proposed class in the action  particularly any defendant that is allegedly liable to the vast majority of the members of the proposed classes  as opposed to simply a few individual class members .,Republican
it is the sponsors ' intention with regard to each of these exceptions that the party opposing federal jurisdiction shall have the burden of demonstrating the applicability of an exemption .,Republican
thus  if a plaintiff seeks to have a class action remanded on the ground that the primary defendants and two-thirds or more of the class members are citizens of the home state  that plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating that these criteria are met .,Republican
similarly  if a plaintiff seeks to have a purported class action remanded because a primary defendant is a state  that plaintiff should have the burden of demonstrating that the exception should apply .,Republican
i thank the chairman for yielding to me .,Republican
i think those examples really reflect the intent of the legislation .,Republican
madam speaker  the legislation also includes a local controversy exception which is intended to ensure that truly local class actions can remain in state court under the legislation .,Republican
under this provision  federal courts are instructed not to exercise jurisdiction over cases that meet all of the following four criteria : first  more than two-thirds of the class members must be the citizens of the state where the suit is brought ; second  there must be at least one in-state defendant from whom significant relief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a significant basis of plaintiffs ' claims ; third  the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related conduct of each defendant must have occurred in the state where the action was originally filed ; and  fourth  no other class action has been filed during the preceding 3 years asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants .,Republican
madam speaker  i would ask that the chairman elaborate on these criteria .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to commit .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for his leadership in moving this legislation forward and in working with the senate to accomplish that as well .,Republican
i hope this colloquy will provide guidance on the very important jurisdictional provisions in s. 5 and the sponsor 's intent .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman for yielding me time and for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor and for working with the senate to achieve the compromise that we need .,Republican
the gentlewoman from california ( ms.,Republican
pelosi )  the minority leader  called this an extreme republican measure .,Republican
apparently  she has not spoken to her own fellow san franciscan and senior senator from her state  dianne feinstein  who negotiated the compromise that has brought this legislation to the floor of the house  or to senator chuck schumer  also a member of the committee on the judiciary on the democratic side in the senate  or 16 other democratic senators who voted for this legislation .,Republican
she also apparently has not spoken to members of her own democratic caucus  many of whom have voted for this legislation in each of the last three congresses that have passed the house of representatives and many more of whom will vote for the legislation today .,Republican
a number of the folks who have spoken on the other side of the aisle criticizing the legislation have cited total inaccuracies about what the legislation will do .,Republican
the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
markey ) would not yield to me  but he said that the amerada hess case in new hampshire  with gasoline leaking into groundwater  would not be heard in the state court ; but if you live in new hampshire and you have gasoline leaking in your groundwater and virtually all of the plaintiffs are new hampshire residents  the case  under this bill  would be heard in the state courts .,Republican
some have mentioned the vioxx case against merck would be affected by this  and they have argued that senate 5 should be rejected because it will hurt consumers bringing vioxx cases against merck .,Republican
the truth  however  is that this legislation will have absolutely no effect on vioxx suits .,Republican
here is why : the majority of personal injury cases brought against merck are individual cases that would not be affected by the bill in any manner whatsoever .,Republican
these include more than 400 personal injury cases that are part of a coordinated proceeding in new jersey state court .,Republican
none of these cases will be affected by the bill because they are neither class actions nor mass actions .,Republican
now  what kind of cases would be affected by this legislation ?,Republican
well  let me show my colleagues how a select number of class action trial lawyers play the class action wheel of fortune .,Republican
how about the kay bee toys case where the lawyers got $ 1 million in attorneys fees and the consumers got 30 percent off selected products of an advertised sale at kay bee toys for one week .,Republican
or the poland spring water case where the lawyers got $ 1.35 million in the wheel of fortune and the consumers got coupons to buy more of the water that the lawyers were alleging was defective .,Republican
how about the ameritech case .,Republican
the price goes up  $ 16 million for those lawyers ; the consumers  $ 5 phone cards .,Republican
how about the premier cruise line case .,Republican
the lawyers got nearly $ 900  000 .,Republican
the consumers got $ 30 to $ 40 off of their next thousand dollar cruise  with a coupon to buy more of the product the lawyers were alleging was defective .,Republican
or the computer monitor litigation  $ 6 million in attorneys fees in a case alleging that the size of the computer screen was slightly off  and therefore  they were entitled to something .,Republican
what did the consumers get ?,Republican
a $ 13 rebate to purchase their next purchase .,Republican
how about the register.com case  $ 642  500 to the lawyers .,Republican
the consumers  $ 5-off coupons .,Republican
my favorite case  the case against chase manhattan bank  the lawyers got $ 4 million in attorneys fees  but the plaintiffs that allegedly the opponents of this bill are protecting  they got 33 cents .,Republican
here is one of the actual checks .,Republican
the catch was that at the time  to accept this 33-cent magnanimous check  they had to use a 34-cent postage stamp to send in the acceptance to get their 33-cent fee .,Republican
how about the case that president bush cited last week when he highlighted problems with this of the woman who had a defective television set against thompson electronics  found she had been made a member of a class action seeking redress of her grievances and many others against thompson electronics .,Republican
what did the lawyers get ?,Republican
$ 22 million in attorneys fees .,Republican
what did she get ?,Republican
a coupon for $ 25 to $ 50 off her next purchase of exactly what she did not want  another thompson electronics television set .,Republican
now  the gentlewoman from california  the minority leader  also cited the washington post .,Republican
let me tell my colleagues  the washington post has repeatedly endorsed this legislation  along with over a hundred other major newspapers  the washington post  the wall street journal  the financial times  christian science monitor  on and on the list goes .,Republican
and here is what the washington post said  and that is why we need to pass this legislation today .,Republican
the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees .,Republican
this is not justice .,Republican
it is an extortion racket that only congress can fix .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to pass the bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time  and i thank the gentleman from new york ( mr.,Republican
weiner ) for raising the points on those cases on the class action wheel of fortune because he makes a good point .,Republican
in not one of those cases was there any wrongdoing found on the part of any of those defendants because all of those were settlements .,Republican
they were extortionate settlements because they are in the jurisdiction of a court where they know they are facing a hanging judge and a hanging jury .,Republican
the gentleman also raised another good point  and we should not leave plaintiffs in the situation where they get a 33-cent check or a coupon for a box of cheerios  like in another case  and that is what this bill does .,Republican
it requires extra-special scrutiny for coupon settlement cases so the courts will no longer let the manufacturers ' attorneys and the defendants ' attorneys come in with a settlement that simply gets out of the case  that gives the plaintiffs ' attorney a huge sum of money and everyone else walks away and the plaintiffs get left holding the bag .,Republican
mr. speaker  the gentleman ought to talk to his colleague  the senior senator from new york  the predecessor of his seat  who supported this legislation .,Republican
in addition  when the gentleman talks about abuse of plaintiffs in these cases  take into consideration the nationwide class action lawsuit filed in alabama against the bank of boston  headquartered in massachusetts  over mortgage escrow accounts .,Republican
the class members won the case but actually lost money .,Republican
amazing .,Republican
under the settlement agreement  the 700  000 class members received small payments of just a couple of dollars or no money at all .,Republican
about a year later  they found out that anywhere from $ 90 to $ 140 had been deducted from their escrow accounts .,Republican
for what ?,Republican
to pay their lawyers ' legal fees  of what ?,Republican
$ 8.5 million .,Republican
and when some of those class members  some of those beleaguered plaintiffs  that i am glad the gentleman from new york is standing up for  sued their class action lawyers for malpractice  the lawyers countersued them for $ 25 million saying that their former clients were trying to harass them .,Republican
this is an extortionate practice .,Republican
a small cartel of class action lawyers around the country are abusing the system and we need to change it .,Republican
madam speaker  i thank the chairman very much for yielding .,Republican
madam speaker  the general principles behind s. 5 and many of the provisions in the legislation are similar to those in h.r.,Republican
1115  which the house passed in 2003  and s. 274  which was voted out of committee in the senate in 2003 but did not ultimately pass .,Republican
to the extent these provisions are the same  the house committee on the judiciary 's report on h.r.,Republican
1115 and the senate committee on the judiciary 's report on s. 274 reflect the intent and understanding of the committee and the sponsors as to the import of these provisions .,Republican
however  there are several new provisions in s. 5 regarding federal jurisdiction over class actions that were not included in prior versions of the legislation .,Republican
i would like to ask my colleague  the chairman of the committee on the judiciary  to provide an overview of the jurisdictional provisions in the legislation  and i would like to discuss the various exceptions included in the legislation and the intent of the sponsors with regard to these exceptions .,Republican
mr. speaker  first let me thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in bringing us to this historic point .,Republican
he and i have been working on this for over 6 years .,Republican
it has passed the house of representatives three times before .,Republican
due to his good work  it has now passed the senate and we have the opportunity to send it to the president .,Republican
he is waiting to sign it and we should n't waste any more time .,Republican
now the truth about class action fairness and vioxx .,Republican
critics have been arguing in the press that s. 5 should be rejected because it will hurt consumers bringing vioxx cases against merck .,Republican
the truth is  however  that this legislation will have absolutely no effect on vioxx suits  and here is why .,Republican
the majority of personal injury cases brought against merck are individual cases that would not be affected by the bill in any manner whatsoever .,Republican
these include more than 400 personal injury cases that are part of a coordinated proceeding in new jersey state court .,Republican
none of these cases will be affected by the bill because they are neither class actions nor mass actions .,Republican
merck has been named in more than 75 statewide and nationwide class actions involving vioxx  but only a small percentage are personal injury class actions .,Republican
to the extent these cases do involve personal injury  most were already brought in or removed to federal court because each potential class member 's claims exceeds $ 75  000 .,Republican
thus  these cases are removable to federal court under the old rules .,Republican
there are a few cases which plaintiffs have joined together in mass action-type cases against merck .,Republican
however  not a single vioxx case has been brought against merck in state court by more than 100 plaintiffs  one of the requirements for removal to federal court under the class action legislation .,Republican
thus  there is no reason to believe that the mass action provision would affect any vioxx-related cases whatsoever .,Republican
most of the class actions have been brought against merck .,Republican
since the legislation is not retroactive  it would absolutely have no effect on the 75 class actions already filed against merck in the wake of the vioxx withdrawal .,Republican
mr. speaker  i would like to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak on this bill today .,Republican
he has been leading a very important discussion and one that i am very pleased has finally come to fruition .,Republican
mr. speaker  there has been a lot of discussion today about class actions and what they do to the economy ; class actions  what they have done to law  because state courts are making national law .,Republican
but i think the most important point about a class action is that a class action 's purpose is to award the plaintiffs who have been injured .,Republican
the intent of these suits is to allow large groups who were similarly harmed by something to recover damages .,Republican
unfortunately  it is the attorneys who have been recovering more money .,Republican
the injured plaintiffs in many cases are recovering basically nothing .,Republican
first  they are denied real relief  and then the attorneys pocket huge amounts of money .,Republican
examples  bank of boston case  the lawyers got 8.5 million .,Republican
the plaintiffs actually lost money .,Republican
in the blockbuster case  the lawyers  9.25 million .,Republican
the plaintiffs got $ 1 off their next movie .,Republican
the coca-cola case  the lawyers got 1.5 million ; the plaintiffs  a 50-cent coupon .,Republican
obviously  these lawsuits are not helping their intended beneficiaries .,Republican
this act will create a consumer class action bill of rights .,Republican
it will protect consumers from the egregious abuses of the class action practice today .,Republican
the plan will require the judges carefully review the settlement and limit the attorneys fees when the value of the settlement received by those class members is minor in comparison or when there is a net loss in the settlement  such as this example where the class members could end up losing money .,Republican
it also will ban settlements that award some class members a large recovery because they live closer to the court .,Republican
it will also allow federal courts to maximize the benefit of class action settlements by requiring that unclaimed settlement funds be donated to charitable organizations .,Republican
mr. speaker  it is just obvious to me that this is a long-overdue bill .,Republican
i encourage my colleagues to support it .,Republican
i encourage my colleagues to ensure that the plaintiffs actually receive their due in these cases .,Republican
madam speaker  pursuant to house resolution 96  i call up the senate bill ( s. 5 ) to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class members and defendants  and for other purposes  and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today in strong support of both the rule and the underlying class-action reform legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  the bottom line is that class-action reform is badly needed .,Republican
currently  certain crafty lawyers are able to game the system by filing large  nationwide class-action suits in certain preferred state courts such as madison county  illinois  where judges are quick to certify classes and quick to approve settlements that give millions of dollars to attorneys and only worthless coupons to their clients .,Republican
looking at this chart  for example  we can see the history of madison county  illinois  which has been called the number one judicial hellhole in the united states .,Republican
there were 77 class-action filings in 2002  and 106 class-action lawsuits filed in 2003 .,Republican
now  the movie bridges of madison county was a love story .,Republican
`` the judges of madison county '' would be a horror flick .,Republican
unfortunately  all too often  it is the lawyers who drive these class-action suits and not the individuals who allegedly have been injured .,Republican
for example  in a suit against blockbuster over late fees  the attorneys received $ 9.25 million ; their clients got a $ 1 off coupon for their next video rental .,Republican
similarly  in a lawsuit against the company that makes cheerios  the attorneys received $ 2 million for themselves  while their clients received a coupon for a free box of cheerios .,Republican
in a nutshell  these out-of-control class-action lawsuits are killing jobs  they are hurting small business people who can not afford to defend themselves  and they are hurting consumers who have to pay a higher price for goods and services .,Republican
fortunately  this legislation provides much-needed reform in 2 key areas .,Republican
first  it eliminates much of the forum shopping by requiring that most of the nationwide class-action suits be filed in federal court .,Republican
second  it cracks down on these coupon-based class-action settlements by requiring that attorney fee awards be based on either the value of the coupons actually redeemed  or by the hours actually billed by the attorney prosecuting the case .,Republican
mr. speaker  this legislation will and should comfortably pass the house of representatives .,Republican
last week  this exact bill received 72 votes in the u.s. senate  and last year we passed a similar bill with 253 votes .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the bill and vote yes on the rule .,Republican
mr. speaker  i 'm pleased join my colleagues here today who support taking a historic first step to breaking one of the main shackles holding back our economy and america 's workforce -- lawsuit abuse .,Republican
for the last decade  the republican congress has worked to end out of control lawsuits .,Republican
today is the day we will pass common-sense legislation and put an end to class action lawsuit abuse .,Republican
i particularly want to praise the efforts of house judiciary chairman jim sensenbrenner for his relentless work .,Republican
without his stewardship  i do n't think th achievement would have become a reality .,Republican
i come from illinois -- the land of lincoln -- where downstate madison county has the dubious distinction as a personal injury lawyer 's paradise .,Republican
no  there are not palm trees or sandy beaches there .,Republican
instead  madison county  illinois  is home to very warm courtrooms where frivolous lawsuits are filed virtually everyday .,Republican
why 's madison county ?,Republican
the answer : `` venue shopping.,Republican
'' cagey trial lawyers have figured out there 's a pretty good likelihood their case -- no matter what its merit -- will literally get its day in court because of favorable judges .,Republican
to use a sports analogy  thanks to willing judges  personal injury lawyers get to play on their `` home court '' each and every time they file a frivolous lawsuit there .,Republican
for instance  a legendary class action case from madison county illustrates what 's wrong with the current legal system .,Republican
in 2000  cable tv customers who filed suit over their cable operator 's late fee policy won their case  but received nothing ... .. not a dime  not a nickel  not a lincoln penny .,Republican
instead  their $ 5.6 million settlement went directly into the pockets of their attorneys .,Republican
how is that justice ?,Republican
how does that help victims ?,Republican
the american people deserve better .,Republican
our working families demand better .,Republican
today 's action takes a step in the right direction to end the so-called tort tax .,Republican
the tort tax makes consumers pay more for the goods and services they use .,Republican
the tort tax adds to the cost of everything we buy because businesses and manufacturers have to cover themselves and their employees -- just in case they get sued by a greedy personal injury lawyer .,Republican
at last estimate  this outrageous tort tax cost the nation 's economy $ 246 billion a year  and by 2006  it will cost the average american nearly $ 1  000 more each year on their purchases because of defensive business practices .,Republican
in closing  as a matter of principle  damage awards should go to the victim  not the lawyers .,Republican
lawsuits should not be `` strike it rich '' schemes for lawyers .,Republican
there has to be some limit to what lawyers can take from their clients .,Republican
otherwise  cagey attorneys end up with the lion 's share of the settlement and the victims end up with little more than scraps .,Republican
madam speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s. 5 .,Republican
madam speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
boucher ) xz4000430 to show the breadth of the bipartisan support of this legislation .,Republican
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
madam speaker  i rise in strong support of s. 5  the class action fairness act of 2005 .,Republican
today marks the culmination of nearly a decade of legislative efforts to end systematic abuse of our nation 's class action system .,Republican
we stand on the cusp of sending landmark legislation on civil-justice reform to the president that has been approved by increasing majorities each time it has been considered by the house in each of the last three congresses and which passed the other body last week with an overwhelming majority of 72 votes .,Republican
since these reforms were first proposed  the magnitude of the class action crisis  the need to address it has become more and more urgent .,Republican
the crisis now threatens the integrity of our civil justice system and undermines the economic vitality upon which job creation depends .,Republican
a major element of the worsening crisis is the exponential increase in state class action cases in a handful of `` magnet '' or `` magic '' jurisdictions  many of which deal with national issues in classes .,Republican
in the last 10 years  state court class actions filings nationwide have increased over 1  315 percent .,Republican
the infamous handful of magnet courts known for certifying even the most speculative class action suits  the increase in filings now exceeds 5  000 percent .,Republican
the only explanation for this phenomenon is aggressive forum shopping by trial lawyers to find courts and judges who will act as willing accomplices in a judicial power grab  hearing nationwide cases and setting policy for the entire country .,Republican
a second major feature of the present class action crisis is a system producing outrageous settlements that benefit only lawyers and trample the rights of class members .,Republican
class actions were originally created to efficiently address a large number of similar claims by people suffering small harms .,Republican
today they are too often used to efficiently transfer the large fees to a small number of trial lawyers  with little benefit to the plaintiffs .,Republican
the present rules encourage a race to any available state courthouse in the hopes of a rubber-stamped nationwide settlement that produces millions in attorney 's fees for the winning plaintiff 's attorney .,Republican
the race to settle produces outcomes that favor expediency and profits for lawyers over justice and fairness for consumers .,Republican
the losers in this race are the victims who often gain little or nothing through the settlement  yet are bound by it in perpetuity .,Republican
and all americans bear the cost of these settlements through increased prices for goods and services .,Republican
the bill before the house today offers commonsense procedural changes that will end the most serious abuses by allowing more interstate class actions to be heard in federal courts while keeping truly local cases in state courts .,Republican
its core provisions are similar to those passed by this body in the last three congresses .,Republican
s. 5 also implements a consumer bill of rights that will keep class members from being used by the lawyers they never hired to engage in litigation they do not know about or to extort money they will never see .,Republican
madam speaker  when the house considered this important reform in the last congress  i remarked that  `` the class action judicial system has become a joke  and no one is laughing except the trial lawyers ... ..,Republican
all the way to the bank.,Republican
'' i imagine that laughter turned to nervous chuckles when s. 5 emerged unscathed from the gauntlet in the other body with 72 votes last week .,Republican
today  as the house prepares to pass this bill  i suspect you could hear a pin drop in the halls of infamous courthouses located in madison county  illinois and jefferson county  texas  where for so long the good times have rolled for forum-shopping plaintiffs ' attorneys and the judges who enable them .,Republican
and when this legislation is signed by the president one day soon  those same halls may echo with sobs and curses because this time justice and fairness and the american people will have the last laugh .,Republican
madam speaker  after years of toil  the moment has arrived .,Republican
the opportunity to restore common sense  rationality  and dignity to our class action system is now before us  and the need for reform has never been more certain .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support the class action fairness act of 2005 .,Republican
madam speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i do not yield .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
hunter ) xz4001910  the chairman of the committee on armed services and one of the biggest supporters of governor schwarzenegger .,Republican
madam speaker  first  i have a lengthy additional statement explaining how this bill is to work .,Republican
we do not have the time in general debate for me to give this statement on the floor  so i will insert the statement relative to the intent of the managers of the bill in the record at this point .,Republican
madam speaker  i would like to provide a brief summary of the provisions in sections 4 and 5 of s. 5  the class action fairness act of 2005 .,Republican
section 4 gives federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $ 5 million  and at least one plaintiff and one defendant are diverse .,Republican
overall  new section 1332 ( d ) is intended to expand substantially federal court jurisdiction over class actions .,Republican
its provisions should be read broadly  with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if removed by any defendant .,Republican
if a purported class action is removed under these jurisdictional provisions  the named plaintiff ( s ) should bear the burden of demonstrating that the removal was improper .,Republican
and if a federal court is uncertain about whether the $ 5 million threshold is satisfied  the court should err in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case .,Republican
the sponsors intend that in a case seeking injunctive relief  a matter be subject to federal jurisdiction under this provision if the value of the matter in litigation exceeds $ 5 million either from the viewpoint of the plaintiff or the defendant  and regardless of the type of relief sought ( e.g.  damages  injunctive relief  or declaratory relief ) .,Republican
similarly  in assessing the jurisdictional amount in declaratory relief cases  the federal court should include in its assessment the value of all relief and benefits that would logically flow from granting the declaratory relief sought by the claimants .,Republican
for example  a declaration that a defendant 's conduct is unlawful or fraudulent will carry certain consequences  such as the need to cease and desist from that conduct  that will often `` cost '' the defendant in excess new subsections 1332 ( d ) ( 3 ) and ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against a defendant in its home state  dividing such cases into three categories .,Republican
first  for cases in which two-thirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed  subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) states that such cases will remain in state court .,Republican
second  cases in which more than two-thirds of the members of the plaintiff class or one or more of the primary defendants are not citizens of the forum state will be subject to federal jurisdiction since such cases are predominantly interstate in nature .,Republican
finally  there is a middle category of class actions in which more than one-third but fewer than two-thirds of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are all citizens first  the court should consider whether the claims asserted are of `` significant national or interstate interest.,Republican
'' under this factor  if a case presents issues of national or interstate significance  that argues in favor of the matter being handled in federal court .,Republican
second  the court should consider whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws other than those of the forum state .,Republican
under this factor  if the federal court determines that multiple state laws will apply to aspects of the class action  that determination would favor having the matter heard in the federal court system  which has a record of being more respectful of the laws of the various states in the class action context .,Republican
the third factor is whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction .,Republican
the purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether the plaintiffs have proposed a `` natural '' class that encompasses all of the people and claims that one would expect to include in a class action  as opposed to proposing a class that appears to be gerrymandered solely to avoid federal jurisdiction by leaving out certain potential class members or claims .,Republican
if the federal court concludes evasive pleading is involved  that factor would favor the exercise of the fifth factor asks whether the number of citizens of the forum state in the proposed plaintiff class ( es ) is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state  and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class ( es ) is dispersed among a substantial number of states .,Republican
if all of the class members who do not reside in the state where the action was filed are widely dispersed among many other states  that point would suggest that the interests of the forum state in litigating the controversy are preeminent .,Republican
however  if a court finds that the citizenship of the other class members is not widely dispersed  the opposite balance would be indicated and a federal forum would be favored .,Republican
finally  the sixth factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last three years .,Republican
the purpose of this factor is efficiency and fairness : to determine whether a matter should be subject to federal jurisdiction so that it can be coordinated with other overlapping or parallel class actions .,Republican
if other class actions on new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( a ) is the `` local controversy exception.,Republican
'' this subsection prohibits federal courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a class action under the foregoing provisions if the plaintiffs clearly demonstrate that each and every one of the following criteria are satisfied in the case at issue .,Republican
first  more than two-thirds of class members are citizens of the forum state .,Republican
second  there is at least one in-state defendant from whom significant relief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a significant basis of plaintiffs ' claims .,Republican
third  the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct  or related conduct  of each defendant were incurred in the state where the action was originally filed .,Republican
and fourth  no other class action asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons has been filed during the preceding three years .,Republican
this provision is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes .,Republican
at the same time  this is a narrow exception that was carefully drafted to ensure that it does not become a jurisdictional loophole .,Republican
thus  in assessing whether each of these criteria is satisfied by a particular case  a federal court should bear in mind that the purpose of each of these criteria is to identify a truly local controversy -- a controversy that uniquely affects a particular locality to the exclusion of all others .,Republican
for example  under the second criterion  there must be at least one real local defendant .,Republican
by that  the sponsors intend that the local defendant must be a primary focus of the plaintiffs ' claims -- not just a peripheral defendant .,Republican
the local defendant must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class ( as opposed to just a subset of the class membership )  as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class .,Republican
similarly  the third criterion is that the principal injuries resulting from the actions of all the defendants must have occurred in the state where the suit was filed .,Republican
by this criterion  the sponsors mean that the fourth and final criterion is that no other class action involving similar allegations has been filed against any of the defendants over the last three years on behalf of the same or other persons .,Republican
once again  the sponsors wish to stress that the inquiry under this criterion should not be whether identical ( or nearly identical ) class actions have been filed .,Republican
rather  the inquiry is whether similar factual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions  regardless of whether the same causes of actions were asserted or whether the purported plaintiff classes were the same ( or even overlapped in significant respects ) .,Republican
new subsections 1332 ( d ) ( 5 ) ( a ) and ( b ) specify that s. 5 does not extend federal diversity jurisdiction to class actions in which ( a ) the primary defendants are states  state officials  or other governmental entities against whom the district court may be foreclosed from ordering relief  or ( b ) the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is fewer than 100 class members .,Republican
the purpose of the `` state action '' cases provision is to prevent states  state officials  or other governmental entities from dodging legitimate claims by removing class actions to federal court and then arguing that the federal courts are constitutionally prohibited from granting the requested relief .,Republican
however  federal courts should proceed cautiously before declining federal jurisdiction under the `` state action '' case exception  and do so only when it is clear that the primary defendants are indeed states  state officials  or other governmental entities against whom the `` court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.,Republican
'' the sponsors wish to stress that this provision should not become a subterfuge for avoiding federal jurisdiction .,Republican
in particular  plaintiffs should not be permitted to name state entities as defendants as a mechanism to avoid federal jurisdiction over class actions that largely target non-governmental defendants .,Republican
the sponsors intend that `` primary defendants '' be interpreted to reach those defendants who are the real `` targets '' of the lawsuit -- i.e.  the defendants that would be expected to incur most of the loss if liability is found .,Republican
it is the sponsors ' intention with regard to each of these exceptions that the party opposing federal jurisdiction shall have the burden of demonstrating the applicability of an exemption .,Republican
the sponsors understand that in assessing the various criteria established in all of these new jurisdictional provisions  a federal court may have to engage in some fact-finding  not unlike what is necessitated by the existing jurisdictional statutes .,Republican
the sponsors further understand that in some instances  limited discovery may be necessary to make these determinations .,Republican
however  the sponsors caution that these jurisdictional determinations should be made largely on the basis of readily available information .,Republican
allowing substantial  burdensome discovery on jurisdictional issues would be contrary to the intent of these provisions to encourage the exercise of federal jurisdiction over class actions .,Republican
under new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 9 )  the act excludes from its jurisdictional provisions class actions that solely involve claims that relate to matters of corporate governance arising out of state law .,Republican
the purpose of this provision is to avoid disturbing in any way the federal vs .,Republican
state court jurisdictional lines already drawn in the securities litigation class action context by the enactment of the securities litigation uniform standards act of 1998 .,Republican
the sponsors intend that this exemption be narrowly construed .,Republican
by corporate governance litigation  the sponsors mean only litigation based solely on ( a ) state statutory law regulating the organization and governance of business enterprises such as corporations  partnerships  limited partnerships  limited liability companies  new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 ) expands federal jurisdiction over mass actions -- suits that are brought on behalf of numerous named plaintiffs who claim that their suits present common questions of law or fact that should be tried together even though they do not seek class certification status .,Republican
mass action cases function very much like class actions and are subject to many of the same abuses .,Republican
under subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 )  any civil action in which 100 or more named parties seek to try their claims for monetary relief together will be treated as a class action for jurisdictional purposes .,Republican
the sponsors wish to stress that a complaint in which 100 or more plaintiffs are named fits the criteria of seeking to try their claims together  because there would be no other apparent reason to include all of those claimants in a single action unless the intent was to secure a joint trial of the claims asserted in the action .,Republican
the sponsors also wish to stress that this provision is when all the claims asserted in the action arise out of an event or occurrence in the state where  the suit is filed and the injuries were incurred in that state and contiguous states ( e.g.  a toxic spill case ) and ( 2 ) when the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public ( and not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class ) pursuant to a state statute specifically authorizing such an action .,Republican
the first exception would apply only to a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects .,Republican
the purpose of this exception is to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local  even though there are some out-of-state defendants .,Republican
by contrast  this exception would not apply to a product liability or insurance case .,Republican
the second exception also addresses a very narrow situation  specifically a law like the california unfair competition law  which allows individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the general public .,Republican
subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 ) ( b ) ( i ) includes a statement indicating that jurisdiction exists only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under section 1332 ( a ) .,Republican
it is the sponsors ' intent that although remands of individual claims not meeting the section 1332 jurisdictional amount requirement may take the action below the 100-plaintiff jurisdictional threshold or the $ 5 million jurisdictional amount requirement  those subsequent remands should not extinguish federal diversity jurisdiction over the action as long as the mass action met the various jurisdictional requirements at the time of removal .,Republican
under subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 ) ( c )  a mass action removed to a federal court under this provision may not be transferred to another federal court under the mdl statute ( 28 u.s.c .,Republican
1407 ) unless a majority of the plaintiffs request such a transfer .,Republican
the sponsors wish to make clear that this restriction on mdl transfers applies only to mass actions as defined in subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 ) ; the legislation does not more broadly restrict the authority of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to transfer class actions removed to federal court under this legislation .,Republican
under subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 11 ) ( d )  the statute of limitations for any claims that are part of a mass action will be tolled while the mass action is pending in federal court .,Republican
the removal provisions in section 5 of the legislation are self-explanatory and attempt to put an end to the type of gaming engaged in by plaintiffs ' lawyers to keep cases in state court .,Republican
they should thus be interpreted with this intent in mind .,Republican
in addition  new subsection 1453 ( c ) provides that an order remanding a class action to state court is reviewable by appeal at the discretion of the reviewing court .,Republican
the sponsors note that the current prohibition on remand order review was added to section 1447 after the federal diversity jurisdictional statutes and the related removal statutes had been subject to appellate review for many years and were the subject of considerable appellate level interpretive law .,Republican
the sponsors believe it is important thank you  madam speaker  for allowing me to provide an explanation of these jurisdictional provisions .,Republican
madam speaker  for purposes of engaging in a colloquy with the two gentlemen from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 and ( mr.,Republican
boucher ) xz4000430  i yield to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
mr. speaker  the bottom line is that class action reform is badly needed .,Republican
currently  crafty lawyers are able to game the system by filing large  nationwide class action suits in certain preferred state courts such as madison county  illinois  where judges are quick to certify classes and quick to approve settlements that give the lawyers millions of dollars in fees and give the clients worthless coupons .,Republican
let us take a look at madison county  illinois with this chart .,Republican
madison county  illinois has been called the number one judicial hellhole in the united states .,Republican
in 2002 we can see there were 77 class action filings  and in 2003 there were 106 class action lawsuits filed .,Republican
the movie `` bridges of madison county '' was a love story .,Republican
the `` judges of madison county '' would be a horror flick .,Republican
unfortunately  all too often it is the lawyer who drives these cases and not the individuals who are supposedly hurt .,Republican
for example  in a suit against blockbuster over late fees  the attorneys received for themselves $ 9.25 million  while their clients got a $ 1-off discount coupon .,Republican
similarly  in a lawsuit against the company who makes cheerios  the lawyers received $ 2 million for themselves ; predictably their clients received a coupon for a box of cheerios .,Republican
in a nutshell  these out-of-control class action lawsuits are killing jobs  they are hurting small business people who can not afford to defend themselves  they are hurting consumers who end up paying higher prices for goods and services .,Republican
this legislation provides much-needed reform in two key areas .,Republican
first  it eliminates much of the forum shopping by requiring most of these nationwide class action suits to be filed in federal court .,Republican
and  second  it cracks down on these coupon-based class action settlements by requiring fee awards to be based on the number of coupons actually redeemed or the number of hours actually billed .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on this class action reform legislation .,Republican
it is about common sense  it is about justice  and it is about time .,Republican
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  under new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 6 )  the claims of the individual class members in any class action shall be aggregated to determine whether the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $ 5 million .,Republican
the sponsors intend this subsection to be interpreted broadly  and if a purported class action is removed under this provision  the plaintiff shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the $ 5 million threshold is not satisfied .,Republican
by the same token  if a federal court is uncertain about whether a case puts $ 5 million or more in controversy  the court should favor exercising jurisdiction over the case .,Republican
this principle applies to class actions seeking injunctive relief as well .,Republican
the sponsors intend that a matter be subject to federal jurisdiction under this provision if the value of the matter in litigation exceeds the $ 5 million  either from the viewpoint of the plaintiff or the viewpoint of the defendant  regardless of the type of relief sought  such as damages  injunctive relief or declaratory relief .,Republican
the sponsors are aware that some courts  especially in the class action context  have declined to exercise federal jurisdiction over cases on the grounds that the amount in controversy in those cases exceeded the jurisdictional threshold only when assessed from the viewpoint of the defendant .,Republican
for example  a class action seeking injunctive relief that would require a defendant to restructure its business in some fundamental way might cost a defendant well in excess of $ 75  000 under current law  but might have substantially less value to each plaintiff or even to the class of plaintiffs as a whole .,Republican
because s. 5 explicitly allows aggregation for the purposes of determining the amount of controversy in class actions  that concern is no longer relevant .,Republican
to the extent plaintiffs seek to avoid this rule by framing their cases as individual actions for injunctive relief  most federal courts have properly held that in an individual case the cost of injunctive relief is viewed from the defendant 's perspective .,Republican
this legislation extends that principle to class actions as well .,Republican
the same approach would apply in a case involving declaratory relief .,Republican
in determining how much money a declaratory relief case puts in controversy  the federal court should include in its assessment the value of all relief and benefits that would logically flow from the granting of the declaratory relief sought by the plaintiffs .,Republican
for example  a declaration that a defendant 's conduct is unlawful or fraudulent will carry certain consequences  such as the need to cease and desist from that conduct that will often cost the defendant in excess of $ 5 million ; or a declaration that a standardized product sold throughout the nation is defective might well put a case over the $ 5 million threshold  even if the class complaint did not affirmatively seek a determination that each class member was injured by the product .,Republican
the bottom line is that new section 1332 ( d ) is intended to substantially expand federal court jurisdiction over class actions  not to create loopholes .,Republican
this provision should be read broadly  with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by a defendant .,Republican
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  i appreciate the gentleman 's question .,Republican
section 4 of the bill gives federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $ 5 million  excluding interests and costs and at least one proposed class member and one defendant are citizens of different states or countries .,Republican
for purposes of the citizenship element of this analysis  s. 5 does not alter current law .,Republican
thus  a corporation will continue to be deemed a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business .,Republican
however  the bill provides that for purposes of this new section  and section 1453 of title 28  an unincorporated association shall be deemed to be a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business and the state under whose laws it organized .,Republican
this provision is added to ensure that unincorporated associations receive the same treatment as corporations for purposes of diversity jurisdiction .,Republican
new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 10 ) corrects this anomaly .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from virginia .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from virginia .,Republican
reclaiming my time  madam speaker  i am pleased to answer the gentleman .,Republican
the first factor is whether the claims asserted are of significant national or interstate interest .,Republican
under this factor  if a case presents issues of national or interstate significance that argues in favor of the matter being handled in federal court  for example  if a class action alleges a nationally distributed pharmaceutical product caused side effects  those cases presumably should be heard in federal court because of the nationwide ramifications of the dispute and the potential interface with federal drug laws .,Republican
under this factor  the federal court should inquire whether the case does present issues of national or interstate significance of this sort .,Republican
if such issues are identified  that point favors the exercise of the federal jurisdiction .,Republican
the second factor is whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws other than those of the forum state .,Republican
the sponsors believe that one of the significant problems posed by multistate class actions in state court is the tendency of some state courts to be less than respectful of the laws of other jurisdictions  applying the law of one state to an entire nationwide controversy and thereby ignoring the distinct and varying state laws that should apply to various claims included in the class  depending upon where they arose .,Republican
under this factor  if the federal court determines that multiple state laws will apply to aspects of the class action  the determination would favor having the matter handled in the federal court system  which has a record of being more respectful of the laws of various states in the class action controversy .,Republican
conversely  if the court concludes that the laws of the state to which the action was filed will apply to the entire controversy  that factor will favor keeping the case in state court .,Republican
the third factor is whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction .,Republican
the purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether the plaintiffs have proposed a natural class  a class that encompasses all the people and claims that one would expect to include in a class action  as opposed to proposing a class that appears to be gerrymandered solely to avoid federal jurisdiction by leaving out certain potential class members or claims .,Republican
if the federal court concludes that evasive pleading is involved  that factor would favor the exercise of federal jurisdiction .,Republican
on the other hand  if the class definition and claims appear to follow a natural pattern  that consideration would favor allowing the matter to be handled by a state court .,Republican
the fourth factor is whether there is a distinct nexus between  a  the forum where the action was brought  and  b  the class members  the alleged harm or the defendants .,Republican
this factor is intended to take account of a major concern that led to this legislation  the filing of lawsuits in the out-of-the-way magnet state courts that have no real relationship to the controversy at hand .,Republican
thus  if a majority of the proposed class action members and the defendants reside in the county where the suit is brought  the court might find a distinct nexus exists .,Republican
the key to this factor is the notion of there being a distinct nexus .,Republican
if the allegedly injured parties live in many other localities  the nexus is not distinct  and this factor would weigh heavily in favor of the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the matter .,Republican
the fifth factor is whether the number of citizens in the forum state in the proposed plaintiff class is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state  and the citizens of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among a substantial number of states .,Republican
this factor is intended to look at the geographic distribution of class members in an effort to determine the forum state 's interest in handling the litigation .,Republican
if all of the out-of-state class members are widely dispersed among many other states  that point would suggest that the interest of the forum state in litigating the controversy are preeminent .,Republican
the sponsors intend that such a conclusion would favor allowing the state court in which the action was originally filed to handle the litigation .,Republican
however  if a court finds that the citizenship of the other class members is not widely dispersed  then a federal forum would be more appropriate because several states other than the forum state would have a strong interest in the controversy .,Republican
the final factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last 3 years .,Republican
the purpose of this factor is to determine whether a matter should be subject to federal jurisdiction so that it can be coordinated with other overlapping or parallel class actions .,Republican
if the other class actions on the same subject have been or are likely to be filed elsewhere  the sponsors intend that this consideration would strongly favor the exercise of federal jurisdiction .,Republican
it is the sponsors ' intention that this factor be broadly interpreted and that plaintiffs not be able to plead around it with creative legal theories .,Republican
if a plaintiff brings a product liability suit alleging consumer fraud or unjust enrichment  and another suit was previously brought against some of the same defendants alleging negligence with regard to the same product  this factor would favor the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the later-filed claim .,Republican
mr. speaker  given the large number of suits already filed and the fact that every former vioxx taker in america is already a proposed class member in numerous class actions  it is unlikely there will be many more class actions after the legislation is enacted .,Republican
it is bad legislation to have something pass that covers all class actions in the country for all time and name one specific product or one specific company in the legislation .,Republican
it is irrelevant anyway .,Republican
now  let me tell you the kinds of cases that are affected by this legislation .,Republican
take a look at the `` class action wheel of fortune '' on this chart .,Republican
it will tell you what we are doing here today .,Republican
you have got the case against ameritech .,Republican
ameritech  the attorneys for the plaintiffs got $ 16 million in attorneys fees .,Republican
what did the plaintiffs they represent get ?,Republican
five-dollar phone cards .,Republican
the premier cruise line case  the lawyers got almost $ 1 million ; the consumers got a $ 30- to $ 40-off coupon for their next cruise .,Republican
the computer monitor litigation case  the lawyers  $ 6 million in fees ; the consumers  a $ 13 rebate against your next future purchase of the alleged defective product .,Republican
register.com  $ 650  000 for the lawyers ; $ 5 for the consumers .,Republican
kb toys  $ 1 million for the lawyers ; 30 percent off your selected product in a unadvertised 1-week sale at kb toys .,Republican
poland spring water  $ 1.35 million for the lawyers ; a coupon for more of the allegedly defective water for the consumers .,Republican
my favorite case  however  is this one  the chase manhattan bank case  where the lawyers got $ 4 million in attorneys fees ; the plaintiffs  a check  we have got one right here  for 33 cents .,Republican
but there was a catch  because if you wanted to accept the 33 cents  you had to use a 34-cent postage stamp to send in your acceptance notice .,Republican
how is that for a bargain for you ?,Republican
and how about the $ 22 million case that president bush cited last week against thompson electronics ?,Republican
the lawyers got $ 22 million in attorneys fees ; the plaintiffs  one of whom was there  got a $ 25- to $ 50-off coupon to buy more of what ?,Republican
the very television set that she was complaining was defective in the first place .,Republican
it is a racket  it is extortionate .,Republican
the people of the country know it .,Republican
when they are asked the question  who benefits from our class action industry today  47 percent say it is the plaintiffs ' lawyers ; 20 percent say it is the lawyers for the companies ; 67 percent of our public recognizes it is the lawyers who benefit from this system .,Republican
it is time we change it .,Republican
this bill does just that .,Republican
it protects american consumers and makes sure that they get justice by examining these ridiculous coupon settlements .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge my colleagues to support this legislation  defeat the motion to commit  and send the bill to the president  and starting very soon  we will have justice for american consumers .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  yes  this provision is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes .,Republican
at the same time  this is a narrow exception that was carefully drafted to ensure that it does not become a jurisdictional loophole .,Republican
thus  each of the criteria is intended to identify a truly local class action .,Republican
first  there must be a primarily local class .,Republican
secondly  there must be at least one real local defendant .,Republican
and by that the drafters meant that the local defendant must be a primary focus of the plaintiffs ' claims  not just a retailer or other peripheral defendant .,Republican
the defendant must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class  as opposed to just a subset of the class membership  as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class .,Republican
for example  in a consumer fraud case  alleging that an insurance company incorporated and based in another state misrepresented its policies  the local agent of the company named as a defendant presumably would not fit this criteria .,Republican
he or she probably would have had contact with only some of the purported class members and  thus  would not be a person from whom significant relief would be sought by the plaintiff class viewed as a whole .,Republican
and  from a relief standpoint  the real demand of the full class in terms of seeking significant relief would be on the insurance company itself .,Republican
third  the principal injuries resulting from the actions of all the defendants must have occurred in the state where the suit was filed .,Republican
this criterion means that all or almost all of the damage caused by the defendants ' conduct occurred in the state where the suit was brought .,Republican
if defendants engaged in conduct that allegedly injured consumers throughout the country  the case would not qualify for the local controversy exception  even if it was only brought as a single state class action .,Republican
and  fourth  no other class action involving similar allegations has been filed against any of the defendants over the last 3 years .,Republican
in other words  if we are talking about a situation that results in multiple class actions  those are not the types of cases that this exception is intended to address .,Republican
i would like to stress that the inquiry under this criterion should not be whether identical or nearly identical class actions have been filed .,Republican
rather  the inquiry is whether similar factual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions  regardless of whether the same causes of action were asserted or whether the proposed plaintiff classes in the prior case was the same .,Republican
madam speaker  i yield to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 .,Republican
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time  i will be happy to explain .,Republican
the mass action provision was included in the bill because mass actions are really class actions in disguise .,Republican
they involve an element of people who want their claims adjudicated together  and they often result in the same abuses as class actions .,Republican
in fact  sometimes the abuses are even worse because the lawyers seek to join claims that have little to do with each other and confuse a jury into awarding millions of dollars to individuals who have suffered no real injury .,Republican
here is how the mass action provision and the current amount-in-controversy provision would work in tandem : suppose 200 people file a mass action in mississippi against a new jersey drug manufacturer and also name a local drug store .,Republican
three of them assert claims for a million dollars apiece  and the rest assert claims of $ 20  000 .,Republican
the federal court would have jurisdiction over the mass action because there are more than 100 plaintiffs  there is minimal diversity  and the total amount of controversy exceeds $ 5 million  and a product liability case does not qualify for the local occurrence exception in the provision .,Republican
then the question becomes  which claims would  in the mass action  the federal judge keep in federal court  and which would be remanded ?,Republican
at this point the judge would have to look at each of the claims very carefully and determine whether or not they meet the $ 75  000 minimum .,Republican
in this regard  i would note that the plaintiffs often seek to minimize what they are seeking in the complaint so that they can stay in state court .,Republican
for example  sometimes plaintiffs leave their claim for punitive damages off the original complaint to make it seem like their claims are smaller than they really are .,Republican
it is our expectation that a federal judge would read a complaint very carefully and only remand claims that clearly do not meet the $ 75  000 threshold .,Republican
if it is likely that a plaintiff is going to turn around in a month and add an additional claim for punitive damages  the federal court should obviously assert jurisdiction over that individual 's claims .,Republican
finally  i would like to stress that this provision in no way is intended to abrogate 8 united states code 3867 to narrow current jurisdictional rules .,Republican
thus  if a federal court believed it to be appropriate  the court could apply supplemental jurisdiction in the mass action context as well .,Republican
with regard to the exceptions  it is our intent that they be interpreted strictly by a court so that they do not become loopholes for an important jurisdictional provision .,Republican
thus  the first exception would apply only in a situation where we are talking about a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects .,Republican
the purpose of this exception is to allow cases involving environmental torts  such as a chemical spill  to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local  even though there are some out-of-state defendants .,Republican
by contrast  this exception would not apply to a product liability or insurance case .,Republican
the sale of a product to different people does not qualify as an event  and the alleged injuries in such a case would be spread out over more than one state or contiguous states even if all of the plaintiffs in a particular case came from one single state .,Republican
the third exception addresses a very narrow situation  specifically a law like the california unfair competition law  which allows individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the general public .,Republican
such a suit would not qualify as a mass action .,Republican
however  the vast majority of cases brought under other states ' consumer fraud laws which do not have a parallel provision could qualify as removable class actions .,Republican
mr. speaker  reclaiming my time  once again  critics of the legislation have it backwards .,Republican
this legislation will streamline jurisdictional inquiries by putting an end to all of the gaming that takes place under the current system  and the so-called delay refers to procedural rules that already exist under the current system .,Republican
under existing law  diversity of citizenship between the parties must exist  both at the time a complaint is filed and at the time a complaint is removed to federal court .,Republican
however  if the plaintiff files an amended complaint in state court that creates jurisdiction  or if subsequent events create jurisdiction  the defendant can then remove the case to federal court .,Republican
current law is also clear that once a complaint is properly removed to federal court  the federal court 's jurisdiction can not be ousted by later events .,Republican
thus  for example  changes in the amount of controversy after the complaint has been removed would not subject a lawsuit to be remanded to state court .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
boucher ) xz4000430 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time and  frankly  for making that important point  that this matter is proceeding to this floor under a bipartisan unanimous vote by the committee on rules ; and the suggestion that the process was unfair or defective is not borne out by both the nature of the debate in the committee on rules and by the unanimous vote that sent this rule to the floor .,Republican
let me move now  mr.,Republican
speaker  to my prepared remarks .,Republican
i rise today in support of the rule for s. 5  the class action fairness act of 2005 .,Republican
i believe it to be a fair rule and one that allows us to fully explore the issues surrounding this legislation .,Republican
furthermore  it makes in order a substantive amendment in the nature of a substitute that the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Republican
conyers ) xz4000800 has worked hard to produce .,Republican
i believe that this will allow a spirited debate and one that will fully explore the many complex issues surrounding class-action reform while still enabling the house to act in an expeditious fashion .,Republican
mr. speaker  while i fully agree that class-action lawsuits are a legitimate tool in civil procedure  these lawsuits are a tool that has been frequently abused over the past years .,Republican
there exist a certain small subset of attorneys who do not represent the best traditions of their colleagues in the legal profession and primarily are concerned with lining their pockets by abusing the class-action process .,Republican
often  this is done through the popular so-called coupon settlement process  where the class of plaintiffs only receive coupons to use from the very same companies they are suing  while the attorneys walk away from the table with millions in cash .,Republican
mr. speaker  this legislation is a necessary step to better ensure and protect our citizens ' rights .,Republican
the ongoing flood of meritless labor and employment litigation has often destroyed reputable companies and has resulted in thousands of layoffs and business restructurings that hurt innocent workers and shareholders alike .,Republican
this legislation would incentivize only those who have legitimate class-action claims to move forward in the legal process and  at the same time  it would disincentivize lawyers from filing meritless claims by increasing sanctions against those who do so .,Republican
mr. speaker  this legislation is a necessary first step and the rule that accompanies it is one that i believe all members should support .,Republican
those who support another approach have the full opportunity to explore it in the minority 's amendment in the nature of a substitute .,Republican
therefore  i urge all members to support the rule and the underlying legislation .,Republican
mr. speaker  i always thought that federal judges protected the rights of everybody .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from utah ( mr.,Republican
cannon ) xz4000590 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr.,Republican
keller ) xz4002120 .,Republican
mr. speaker  pursuant to the rule  i claim the time in opposition .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the democratic substitute amendment and urge my colleagues to reject it .,Republican
the new math behind the substitute amendment rests on the following arithmetic : if you add a number of amendments rejected by large bipartisan majorities in the other body last week and combine them with the amendment ideas overwhelmingly rejected on the house floor by a bipartisan vote last year  the sum will somehow equal a credible solution .,Republican
funny math .,Republican
mr. speaker  this formula simply does not add up .,Republican
the american consumers and businesses will be left with change in their pockets if the amendment passes .,Republican
the democratic substitute is less than the sum of its parts and represents a quotient that renders senate bill 5 's core reform elements meaningless .,Republican
the individual elements of this proposal deserve some comment and explanation .,Republican
first  i note with some amusement that the substitute totally recycles the findings of s. 5 .,Republican
the pages of findings discuss abusive class action windfall settlements for trial attorneys  forum shopping  and the need for more of these large interstate class action cases to be in federal court .,Republican
while the minority substitute reargues the compelling case for reform of the class action system  it is followed by text that will only perpetuate the crisis the findings identify .,Republican
their admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery  and we appreciate that admission ; but the minority sponsors clearly are not ready for step two .,Republican
one element of the substitute amendment is the state attorney general provision allowing any class action to be brought by or on behalf of the state attorney general to be in state court .,Republican
this provision is unnecessary because when state attorneys general sue on behalf of their citizens  those actions are almost always `` parens patriae '' actions  and not class actions ; and the former will be in no way affected by this bill .,Republican
also  the provision could produce troubling associations between attorneys general and plaintiffs ' lawyers .,Republican
for these reasons  the pryor amendment in the other body that this provision copies verbatim failed to garner even 40 votes on the senate floor last week .,Republican
a second element of the substitute is the `` choice of law '' provision .,Republican
this provision would not only eviscerate the bill  but also would overturn 70 years of established supreme court precedent and would export to federal courts a primary expedient of class action abuse we seek to remedy : the reckless application by local courts of the law of one state to the entire nation in large interstate cases .,Republican
this provision is reprinted from a senate amendment by senator feinstein and senator bingaman .,Republican
it was also soundly defeated .,Republican
the third element of the substitute is the so-called labor and civility rights carveout .,Republican
this provision seeks to keep all class actions involving alleged civil rights and labor law violations in state court  despite the fact that the most generous racial discrimination and employment class action settlements in recent years have been in the federal courts .,Republican
the language was also offered in the other body and rejected .,Republican
other major elements of the substitute include one our colleagues might remember as the jackson-lee house floor amendment to the bill in the last congress .,Republican
that amendment makes companies that incorporate abroad for tax purposes a citizen of a state and punishes them by keeping them out of federal court .,Republican
this is at least an admission that going into certain state courts as a defendant is indeed punishment  and that amendment was defeated in this house by the last congress by a vote of 183 to 238 .,Republican
there is also a loophole creating a provision on mass actions and a completely unnecessary public disclosure provision  both based on senate amendments in the other body that were offered and withdrawn .,Republican
what the minority has chosen as a substitute package certainly belies any grumblings about the lack of regular order this year .,Republican
since there is not a single original idea among the provisions that has not already been debated and defeated either in this house or the other body  it is hard to give credence to such complaints .,Republican
this is a package of oldies but not goodies ; oldies that have been rejected and should not be resurrected .,Republican
finally  mr.,Republican
speaker  a vote on this substitute is clearly just a vote to further deny or delay meaningful class action reform  and a vote on the substitute could not in any way be construed as reform of any kind but  rather  support for the trial-lawyer-dominated status quo .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to reject this recycled package of recycled amendments .,Republican
the time for reform of a class action system which is out of control is now .,Republican
i urge my colleague to vote `` no '' on the substitute  and `` yes '' on s. 5 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from missouri ( mr.,Republican
blunt ) xz4000340  the distinguished majority whip .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540  the author of the bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of the time .,Republican
mr. speaker  notwithstanding what we have heard from opponents of this legislation  its passage would not extinguish the legal right of any injured party  whether it be a class action  a mass action  or an individual lawsuit from proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states .,Republican
what the bill does do is it puts some sense into the class action system so that the members of the plaintiff 's class will be fairly and adequately compensated rather than seeing all of their gains go to attorneys and them just getting coupon settlements from the people who have allegedly done them wrong .,Republican
i was particularly perturbed listening to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
markey ) xz4002530  who said that the kids who start smoking at 13 and 14 years old are going to be denied their day in court  and that the tobacco companies are going to end up cashing in on a big bonanza .,Republican
well  i had my staff  while this was going on  look at what has happened to altria  the parent company of philip morris .,Republican
since the other body passed this bill  altria stock has gone down by at least $ 1.50  or 2 percent .,Republican
and today  the reuters story that came out less than an hour ago says that the dow has been dragged down by altria .,Republican
now  if this was the bonanza to investors in altria  the stock would not be going down .,Republican
it is not .,Republican
that is a fallacious argument .,Republican
reject the substitute and pass the bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. speaker  all americans should thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for their leadership on this most important issue .,Republican
the class action fairness act is a bipartisan  sensible bill that clarifies the rights of consumers and restores confidence in america 's judicial system .,Republican
it reforms the class action system and addresses the abuses that harm so many americans .,Republican
we have all heard of the lawsuits in which plaintiffs walk away with pennies  sometimes literally  while the attorneys walk away with millions of dollars in fees .,Republican
this problem will be addressed by providing greater scrutiny over settlements that involve coupons or very small cash amounts .,Republican
this legislation also ensures that deserving plaintiffs are able to make full use of the class action system .,Republican
it allows easier removal of class action cases to federal courts .,Republican
this is important because class actions tend to affect numerous americans and often involve millions of dollars .,Republican
federal court is the right place for such large lawsuits .,Republican
moving more class actions to federal courts also prevents one of the worst problems in class actions today  forum shopping .,Republican
mr. speaker  while many concessions were made on both sides  this is still a very worthwhile bill that contains many good reforms  and i fully support it and look forward to its enactment into law and also encourage my colleagues to support it as well .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in support of s. 5  the class action fairness act .,Republican
this legislation will work to balance class actions .,Republican
currently  plaintiffs ' lawyers take advantage of the system by bringing large  national lawsuits in specific jurisdictions with relaxed certification criteria .,Republican
attorneys are increasingly filing interstate class actions in state courts  mostly in what are known as `` magnet '' jurisdictions .,Republican
courts in these jurisdictions are attractive to lawyers because they routinely approve settlements in which attorneys receive large fees and the class members receive virtually nothing  and they also decide the claims of other state 's citizens under the court 's state law .,Republican
this results in more and more class actions being losing propositions for everyone involved -- except for the lawyers who brought them .,Republican
the class action fairness act works to improve our legal system by allowing larger interstate class action cases to be heard in federal courts  closing the magnet jurisdiction loophole .,Republican
this bill will also make it easier for local businesses to avoid harassment .,Republican
currently  plaintiffs ' lawyers can name a local business in a nationwide liability suit to stay out of federal court .,Republican
this legislation will put an end to this unfair practice .,Republican
finally  s. 5 protects consumers with a consumer class action bill of rights .,Republican
the bill of rights includes several provisions designed to ensure class members -- not their attorneys -- are the primary beneficiaries of the class action process  and are not simply awarded a coupon at the end of a trial .,Republican
allowing judges to limit attorney 's fees when the value of the settlement received by the class member is small in comparison and banning settlements that award some class members more simply because they live closer to the court will make class action suits more fair and help compensate the people who were wronged  not the attorney 's handling their case .,Republican
i strongly support s. 5 and encourage my colleagues to do so as well .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
smith ) xz4003811 .,Republican
mr. speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise today to support the rule and the underlying legislation ; and i want to thank my colleague from georgia for yielding me time .,Republican
mr. speaker  we have all received the class action settlement notices in our mail boxes  i know i have  not even realizing we were part of a class action lawsuit nor ever asking to be part of the lawsuit .,Republican
and not only that  but you never get to meet this attorney who will represent you .,Republican
as consumers  we need to know that we will eventually bear the cost of these companies that have to settle large class actions because it is easier to settle than to try to litigate against the trial lawyers .,Republican
earlier this week  the georgia general assembly moved forward with major legislation to reform the legal system  something i fought for during my time there .,Republican
this legislation continues that effort and takes a huge step forward to protect consumers by limiting these huge interstate class action lawsuits .,Republican
mr. speaker  federal courts have had jurisdiction over substantial cases between citizens of different states since the founding of this nation .,Republican
but due to the interpretations of the laws  state courts have had to bear the brunt of class action lawsuits in this country .,Republican
this legislation is a fantastic bipartisan effort to reform the legal system and is a good first step toward addressing the costs of litigation on small businesses  large businesses  and all americans .,Republican
i encourage my colleagues to support this effort ; and i appreciate the leadership shown by the speaker  the majority leader  and the chairman of the committee on the judiciary towards getting this legislation passed through the senate and on the desk of the president .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to support this measure  the rule and the legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise today in support of h.r.,Republican
27  the job training improvement act .,Republican
through local and state workforce investment boards  this legislation will strengthen job training programs to meet the needs of local businesses  many of which rely heavily on information technology  it .,Republican
in the span of just two decades  information technology has become a commonplace part of our lives and has also created nearly 10 million jobs in the united states .,Republican
information technology is a factor in the productivity and success of many different sectors of our economy .,Republican
whether one is an auto mechanic  a dentist  or a farmer  it skills are essential -- and will be increasingly essential -- to one 's job performance and productivity .,Republican
simply put  the it industry and its workforce are significant contributors to productivity  innovation and global competitiveness .,Republican
it is for this reason  mr.,Republican
chairman  that the committee report encourages states to examine whether providers of training offer the opportunity to obtain an industry-developed and maintained certification or credential .,Republican
this is important  in as much as it recognizes that the industries themselves are the most qualified to determine what skills their workforce will need to succeed and excel .,Republican
this is especially true with respect to the constantly changing and ever-evolving it industry .,Republican
through certification  individuals receive validation of a level of expertise .,Republican
this  in turn  can increase an individual 's ability to find and retain a good job that utilizes that training .,Republican
employers also benefit when certification assures a level of skill that an individual could bring to a job .,Republican
the success of wia in expanding the computer skills of americans -- through training and certification -- will improve the productivity of every sector of our economy .,Republican
this in turn will make america more competitive globally and is an effective step toward creating good jobs right here in the united states .,Republican
mr. speaker  not too long ago  our nation 's courts were a place where americans were able to seek justice .,Republican
today  however  the system has become a playground for personal injury trial lawyers as they file sham  abusive cases in lawsuit-friendly counties .,Republican
and all too often the attorneys collect multimillion-dollar settlements for themselves  while their clients  the real victims  get left with nothing more than a coupon  often worth nothing more than the paper upon which it is printed .,Republican
recently  a large national video rental chain  after being named in 23 class-action lawsuits  agreed to provide consumers in the lawsuit with dollar coupons  and attorneys in this case received over $ 9 million .,Republican
even more outrageous is the case where consumers were awarded 33 cents each in a settlement with a well-known national bank  not even enough to buy a stamp  while attorneys in the case walked away with $ 4 million .,Republican
mr. speaker  this amount of money distorts the incentives for personal injury lawyers .,Republican
they no longer represent their clients ; they become coplaintiffs .,Republican
it is past time we did something about it .,Republican
that is why we should return commonsense justice to the american people by passing s. 5  the class action fairness act .,Republican
mr. speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 126 and ask for its immediate consideration .,Republican
mr. speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
mcgovern ) xz4002630  pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
during consideration of this resolution  all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only .,Republican
mr. speaker  house resolution 126 is a structured rule providing for 1 hour of general debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on education and the workforce .,Republican
the rule makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report  and for the time specified in the report .,Republican
and finally  the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am pleased to stand before the house today in strong support of this rule and support of the underlying resolution legislation  h.r.,Republican
27  the job training improvement act of 2005 .,Republican
the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( subcommittee chairman mckeon ) and the committee members from both sides of the aisle are to be commended for their diligence and hard work in putting together a comprehensive measure reauthorizing vital job training programs while  at the same time  providing for improvements of those programs aimed at providing greater flexibility  accountability  targeting federal dollars where they will be most effective and where there is the highest demonstrated need .,Republican
mr. speaker  my favorite movie of all time has always been `` inherit the wind.,Republican
'' i still think it is spencer tracy 's greatest role .,Republican
but in that he  playing the character of henry drummond  talks about the other main character  matthew harrison brady  who was a well intentioned  yet flawed  character .,Republican
and in talking about his death  drummond says of brady  a giant once lived in that body .,Republican
but matt brady got lost because he was looking for god too high and up too far away .,Republican
federal government is a lot like matt brady .,Republican
we are well intentioned  the greatest of desire to serve ; but we oftentimes get lost and allow too many people to fall through cracks and harm people because we try to solve problems from too high up and administer programs from too far away .,Republican
from this isolated hall  we often concoct specific standards that fail people who have the needs but do not fit our preconceived standards .,Republican
last wednesday in my district at a town meeting  i met a young lady by the name of micaela  who offered me also this five-page letter of her efforts and her concerns .,Republican
she is in need of vocational rehabilitation services  but does not quite fit our standards we have designed .,Republican
in her letter she said in her years of trying to receive services that she was told she had too many disabilities  too few disabilities .,Republican
you could not visually see her disability .,Republican
she was too young  too old  and too rare of a circumstance .,Republican
you name it  she had heard it .,Republican
and she has also been basically told that i am not worth helping  hiring  or even listening to .,Republican
oftentimes the federal government  in fact  not oftentimes .,Republican
the federal government 's only advantage is that of uniformity .,Republican
by definition we can deal with people only as objects on a factory conveyor belt designed to meet the federal factory specifications .,Republican
but if we truly believe that people are each individuals  that they have a spark of divinity  that individual needs are there that require individualized help  then we do not need uniformity .,Republican
what we need is creativity  efficiency  and caring ; and that can only be done effectively on the state levels  which is why this particular bill has gone from several years ago  63 programs  has now taken three funding streams and tried to bring it into one so they could help individual people by trying to apply 70 percent of the funding that has been given to students to those who have been unserved and out of school  to create a demonstration project for personal reemployment accounts to meet individual needs prior to coming to congress  i had the opportunity  like many of you  of serving in the state legislature  and i was a teacher for a long time .,Republican
in that position  or those positions  i witnessed firsthand the years of oftentimes federal programs and mandates shoved on states  on local school districts  on local units of governments with this one-size-fits-all uniform approach .,Republican
what was often  too often  left out were  quite frankly  the bona fide local needs .,Republican
a uniform federal approach stifles innovation with the heavy hand of federal regulations and professionalism .,Republican
the philosophy behind h.r.,Republican
27  therefore  is to give governors as the chief political officer of the states the flexibility over job training programs to promote economic development and jobs based upon local needs  and that way  the states become responsive to employment and to job markets .,Republican
recently  i attended a community college  a community technical college in my district .,Republican
and i was amazed at the benefits i saw of partnerships with local private industry  government contractors  and local employers coming together .,Republican
in their diesel program  to find the kinds of materials that were provided by the industry  they have to get hands-on experience for first-rate technicians .,Republican
and in program after program in that particular college  i saw  through innovation and hard work  the community college has been able to leverage the state and federal dollars and to attract private contributions for equipment and training that met the need of training qualified workers in the high-tech future .,Republican
vocational rehabilitation services in state after state does the same thing .,Republican
but these type partnerships are not just allowed in this bill .,Republican
they are encouraged under this legislation  which is vital in helping provide workers for the competition of the 21st century .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
27 is strongly supported by a coalition of community colleges which authorizes $ 250 million for community-based job training grants to strengthen the role of those communities ' colleges and to promote the united states ' full workforce potential .,Republican
we face a 21st-century challenge in an ever-changing technology and the aging american workforce .,Republican
we must provide states  local workforce boards  governors flexibility to fit real people with real skills for real jobs .,Republican
and they vary in need from state to state .,Republican
we must allow them the opportunity to work together as they see fit to help people like micaela .,Republican
i further support h.r.,Republican
27 because it targets federal funds to groups of youths who are presently underserved  because it provides for individual self-help efforts .,Republican
i would like to point out also that h.r.,Republican
27 builds upon legislation passed in the 108th congress  namely h.r.,Republican
1261  the workforce reinvestment and adult education act of 2003  which was passed by this house .,Republican
there may be some who would oppose this bill because it respects both the letter and the spirit of existing law .,Republican
if there is a problem with existing law  this is not the proper venue for that discussion .,Republican
let us not  in the debate over the rule or the bill  lose focus and lose sight of our goal  which is to help the micaelas of this nation who need services  which are and will continue to be distributed fairly without precondition .,Republican
it is significant that we not confuse services rendered with the desire of some to sanitize and regulate legally diverse practices  reaffirmed in a rare moment of sanity by the courts  which do not impact the rendering of those employment services .,Republican
others beside sanctioned-government programs care and help and are effective  and we ought to forget the old pattern of confrontation and pointless attacks on groups that we see as different ; we should join for the common goal of helping people .,Republican
mr. speaker  this is a good rule  supporting a bill that has been discussed and amended in committee through regular order .,Republican
the rule allows for three specific amendments to focus discussion on key elements of the proposal .,Republican
i am looking forward to riveting debate on this bill  with the realization our goal is to help the micaelas of this world who have been hurt because there have been programs which are too high  too far away  and forgot our purpose of helping real people .,Republican
i urge adoption of the rule .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Republican
ehlers ) xz4001190 .,Republican
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
may i respond simply to the arguments about our veterans because they are so important to us .,Republican
let me reiterate that h.r.,Republican
27 does not harm worker-retaining programs for veterans .,Republican
not one dollar from this account comes that is meant to help veterans with their training .,Republican
the programs that we already have in place  specifically the disabled veterans ' outreach program  the local veterans employment representative program  the vocational rehabilitation program  already are required to contribute to the infrastructure of these one-stop career center programs .,Republican
any money that would come to the one-stop center would be coming out of their administrative funds  not from the money going directly to the training of veterans .,Republican
that is an area that was specifically covered in this bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  as we talk about the economy and talk about the need to have an economic renaissance  to see this continue .,Republican
as i said earlier  we have had 40 consecutive months of economic growth .,Republican
a lot of times women do not look forward to that 40th birthday  but when we talk about the 40th month of economic growth  that is certainly a date that we want to celebrate .,Republican
the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Republican
king ) mentioned tax reform and the cost of 22 cents of every dollar of manufactured good in this nation being eaten up by compliance  and the importance of us having a wonderful debate about how we lower that cost so that every sector of our economy is going to see greater productivity and is going to see growth .,Republican
we know that working on our tax reform issues  working on tort reform issues to eliminate frivolous lawsuits  are going to be a way that we can begin to benefit  that we can see the products that are manufactured here be more competitive in a global marketplace .,Republican
as we look at the opportunities for trade in tennessee  for example  where our exports have increased every year for the past 5 years  and we know that does equal jobs .,Republican
over the past 2 years  as the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Republican
king ) said  we created about 2.7 million new jobs  and that will soon in a couple of months be 1.5 million new jobs per year .,Republican
there are a couple of industries that have seen good growth in the past couple of months : apparel  textiles  transportation and equipment  electronic components and equipment  chemicals  industrial and commercial equipment and computers  instruments  photographic equipment  metals  food  wood and wood products .,Republican
virtually every state in the union can claim at least one of these industrial sectors .,Republican
in fact  one of the things that we have seen about job creation is that in 48 of our 50 states we have seen jobs growth .,Republican
that is impressive .,Republican
over the past year  48 of our 50 states have seen jobs growth .,Republican
that is why we are beginning to see this 40 months of overall economic growth  21 straight months where we are seeing increases in the manufacturing sector  and we know all of this means jobs .,Republican
it all means jobs that are being created .,Republican
we know that there is a lot of work ahead that we need to do to be certain that this economy keeps growing .,Republican
mr. speaker  much of our focus this session is going to be on economic growth  economic competitiveness  doing the things that encourage  that create the right environment .,Republican
our government does not create jobs  it is this free enterprise system that creates jobs  and doing things so we help create the right investment  focusing on tax reform and trade issues  on regulatory reform and on energy independence .,Republican
these are the areas that are going to have a tremendous impact on our economy as it expands .,Republican
we will continue to see growth in those sectors .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms.,Republican
foxx ) xz4006430 who is new to us this congress .,Republican
the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms.,Republican
foxx ) xz4006430 has come to our congress this year and is serving on the committee on education and the workforce .,Republican
and much of her focus  even though her ph,Republican
d .,Republican
is in education  she understands the importance of an educated workforce and lifelong learning and developing the skills that are so necessary to be productive in your job  to be satisfied in your job .,Republican
the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms.,Republican
foxx ) xz4006430 has some thoughts she would like to share with us tonight on economic competitiveness .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time  and i move the previous question on the resolution .,Republican
the previous question was ordered .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) .,Republican
mr. speaker  we are going to talk about economic competitiveness in the economy tonight  but before we start on that topic  i just want to draw attention to a couple of things that have appeared in the newspaper and talk about iraq and the middle east .,Republican
there is an article that i pulled from the wires today  2  000 demonstrate at an iraqi bombing site  and this is really quite an amazing story  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
this is from baghdad : more than 2  000 people demonstrated tuesday at the site of a car bombing south of baghdad that killed 125 people chanting no to terrorism .,Republican
mr. speaker  our hearts go out to those individuals and their families  those that have lost their lives  and certainly our hearts continue to go out to the families of each and every man and woman in our military service .,Republican
i think we join with every one of them  all of our military families and with all of these iraqis who love freedom and are loving having the opportunity to grasp on to freedom  and we join them in saying no to terrorism and standing strong for freedom .,Republican
another article that i saw today from newsday  mr.,Republican
speaker  some arabs see beginning of a new era  and i think this is very important that we pay attention to this .,Republican
one of my colleagues was talking about the headlines that we do not see on some of the national media  some of the leftist media  and i think this one is worthy of a mention .,Republican
it was a scene the arab world 's autocratic regimes have dreaded  and through the power of satellite tv  it could catch on as fast as the latest music video .,Republican
peaceful  enormous crowds carrying flags and flowers  bringing down a government .,Republican
what happened in lebanon this week  analysts say  is the beginning of a new era in the middle east  one in which popular demand pushes the momentum for democracy and people 's will can no longer be disregarded .,Republican
mr. speaker  our president has said that would happen .,Republican
repeatedly  he talks about how in the heart of every man and woman is the desire to be free and to seek that freedom and to have hope and to have opportunity .,Republican
we have all heard our president say freedom is not our gift to the world ; freedom is god 's gift to all people .,Republican
it is so appropriate that we acknowledge that freedom  that we appreciate the sacrifice that is there for that freedom because it is through the expansion of that freedom that we enjoy the fruits and the benefits of a free society .,Republican
one of those is the opportunity to dream big dreams and have great adventure  have great successes and to see that lived out in our lives .,Republican
for many americans  that is the opportunity to reach economic goals ; to build businesses  to have a better life for their family .,Republican
and tonight we are going to spend an hour discussing the republican policies about encouraging entrepreneurship and economic growth in this great nation .,Republican
we are going to highlight the republican agenda for creating jobs in america .,Republican
and it is clear that after battling the recession of 2001  weathering a terrorist attack cost us billions .,Republican
there are even estimates that the cost to the american economy of september 11 and the travesty that took place there was $ 2 trillion  a full quarter of our nation 's productivity for a year .,Republican
after fighting an expensive global war on terrorism  being in the middle of that fight  we have faced significant challenges and we have made some very wise decisions .,Republican
over the past couple of years  despite very heavy criticism from some of our colleagues and from the tax-and-spend liberals  we  as a congress  have made tax cuts  have reduced the tax burden that the american people are paying .,Republican
mr. speaker  it is certainly something that i know  as millions of americans tonight are sitting down at their kitchen tables with pencil and paper and beginning to look at those forms  filling out their federal income tax filings  that they are noticing the difference that the tax cuts we have passed are making in their lives .,Republican
certainly in tennessee  i know there are tennesseeans noticing for the first time in 20 years that they have the opportunity to deduct the sales tax they are paying from their federal income tax filing .,Republican
it is amazing to me  and should be troubling to many americans  that many across the aisle had the audacity to oppose this tax relief we have passed .,Republican
they have opposed making some of these cuts and reductions .,Republican
we are trying to be certain that the american public has more money in their pocketbook ; that they have the opportunity to decide how to spend that money ; and that they have the opportunity to grow those businesses .,Republican
we have known that small businesses and working families need tax relief  and we have fought hard to make that happen so that we see the opportunity right there for our economy  for the growth in our economy  for the opportunity for competitiveness not on just a local scale  not just on a local scale  but on a global scale .,Republican
mr. speaker  our support for tax relief has been vindicated  and we see that in the economic figures that are out there .,Republican
this past week we found the economy grew faster than expected in the last few months of 2004 .,Republican
they revised the growth estimate up from 3.1 to 3.8 .,Republican
and for a lot of folks who are economic news junkies  they know that 3.8 is a pretty good rate .,Republican
for those that are casual listeners  that is something we can be proud of  and we can talk about that .,Republican
a 3.8 percent growth is very substantial .,Republican
in february  we had the twenty-first consecutive month  that is twenty-first consecutive months  of increased economic activity in the manufacturing sector .,Republican
i want to be certain everybody hears and understands that : twenty-first months of consecutive increases in economic activity in the manufacturing sector .,Republican
that is nearly 2 years of growth .,Republican
i think that is absolutely outstanding .,Republican
for some of the tool and die manufacturers that are in my district  from some of the manufacturers that we see of various component parts  of items that are being created  how exciting that they are seeing growth ; that they are seeing growth in their jobs that they have right there in these local communities .,Republican
and that is not all of it .,Republican
the overall economy grew for the fortieth  that is 4-0  the fortieth consecutive month in february .,Republican
that is more than 3 years of solid economic expansion .,Republican
mr. speaker  these are figures that are hard to argue with .,Republican
that 3.8 percent was our economic growth .,Republican
that got revised up for the last quarter of 2004 .,Republican
we have had twenty-first consecutive months of increases in productivity in the manufacturing sector .,Republican
we have had 40 consecutive months of overall economic growth .,Republican
that means something is working right .,Republican
something is working right .,Republican
tax relief was needed  and we see that that tax relief is beginning to pay off .,Republican
i have another article here .,Republican
i had the opportunity to do a little reading over the break  mr.,Republican
speaker .,Republican
this one is from the financial times .,Republican
look at this headline : `` u.s. chiefs ' confidence highest in 3 years.,Republican
'' well  that is a pretty good thing .,Republican
the people that are running the companies  the people that are deciding whether to expand  whether to make capital investments  whether to create new jobs  they have a great deal of confidence .,Republican
it says here : `` confidence in the economy at the u.s. biggest companies has soared to the highest level in 3 years as increasing numbers plan to spend more on capital investment.,Republican
'' well  who would have thunk ?,Republican
you never would have thought that was happening if you were listening to some of our friends across the aisle .,Republican
because they do not want to talk about the good news .,Republican
they do not want to talk about 21 straight months of manufacturing gains  4-0  40 consecutive months of overall economic growth .,Republican
here is one that describes the results as `` extremely positive '' ; another one  talking about capital investments by business  `` are the best indicators of growth at this stage of recovery  '' and that this bodes well for the economy .,Republican
now  mind you  these are not small businesses .,Republican
these are big companies .,Republican
so we are seeing it with our small businesses  and we are seeing it with some of our new companies .,Republican
republicans believe that government must remove the obstacles to growth .,Republican
and it does not matter if you are a big or small company  it does not matter if you are an entrepreneur  it does not matter if you are new or some of our wonderful companies that have been there for 100 years .,Republican
we have to get rid of some of the obstacles .,Republican
and though some of our folks do not like to talk about rolling back taxes  rolling back those taxes is removing an obstacle .,Republican
another obstacle is the high cost of compliance with those taxes .,Republican
another obstacle is onerous regulation that comes from some of our federal agencies .,Republican
well  what do you know .,Republican
when you start rolling that back  making the system easier to comply with  american entrepreneurs expand and they create jobs .,Republican
that is something  is it not ?,Republican
get the government out of the way  and you are going to see free enterprise go do what they are geared up to do  do what they are best at doing  do what they dream about doing  what they spend their lives trying to figure out how to do : how to create jobs  how to build a better mousetrap  how to get out there and sell that better mousetrap to people that are ready to buy improved products .,Republican
it is a great system .,Republican
the way this economy works is something to get excited about  and i am thrilled that we have had the opportunity to see this kind of economic growth .,Republican
mr. speaker  i am joined here on the floor tonight by one of my colleagues  a gentleman from the freshman class i served in in the 108th congress  the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Republican
king ) xz4002201 .,Republican
he knows a lot about how the economy works .,Republican
he is a small businessman  a farmer  and he does a lot of thinking when he gets out there on that tractor  and he brings a lot of wisdom to this chamber .,Republican
so  mr.,Republican
speaker  i yield to him at this time .,Republican
i thank the gentlewoman for bringing her perspective to the debate and for celebrating  allowing us to celebrate with the good people of forsythe county  north carolina  as they welcome 700 new jobs to their area .,Republican
how exciting that is  and how exciting for us that we have a program like the workforce development programs that are very successful  that assist in retraining folks .,Republican
i know in my 7th congressional district in tennessee  we have seen tremendous success with the workforce development program .,Republican
as a matter of fact  we have a program in montgomery county  tennessee  that is really attuned to the needs of our veterans and to our military spouses and our military retirees .,Republican
and they are going to be honored later this week for their excellent work that they are doing for jobs retraining  helping people focus on the importance of developing and having that career .,Republican
jobs and education  they go hand in hand .,Republican
they are very important components of our economic competitiveness  just as tax reform  just as tort reform and the other things that we have discussed this evening .,Republican
mr. speaker  at this time i would like to recognize a member of the freshman class  new to us  but with a tremendous amount of experience in his home state of texas where he has been a part of the business community  has served as a judge  and is a skilled legislator .,Republican
the gentleman from texas ( mr.,Republican
gohmert ) is going to speak with us for a few moments about some of the things that are happening in texas as in the process with our economic competitiveness issues .,Republican
mr. speaker  i want to thank the gentleman from texas .,Republican
and i would like to commend him for meeting with the students and working with the students from grace high school in tyler  texas  and for their study  their caring about the free enterprise system and seeking greater information on that .,Republican
how exciting that they are doing that .,Republican
you know  mr.,Republican
speaker  one of the things we are hearing from business schools all across the country  one of the things we are hearing from high schools  from tech schools is that more and more people are saying  i want to be an entrepreneur .,Republican
i want to start my own business .,Republican
i want to see if i can grab on to that american dream of owning my own company  starting a company  having an idea  watching that idea come to fruition in the form of a company that creates jobs .,Republican
and it is so encouraging to me that the republican leadership and our majority in this house is committed to doing the things that are going to be necessary to continue economic growth  long-term sustained economic growth like we have seen over the past 40 months .,Republican
i have got another article from washingtonpost.com that i had pulled today .,Republican
this one is really interesting .,Republican
construction spending rose a strong seven-tenths of a percent in january  a month when generally they are not going to see that kind of increase .,Republican
this pushed total construction activity to a record high of just over $ 1 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and followed an even larger 1.2 percent rise in december .,Republican
what we are seeing is confidence and belief and the fact that people believe in the strength of this economy .,Republican
we have a freshman member from kentucky ( mr.,Republican
davis ) xz4006331 who has joined this congress this year .,Republican
he is with us for just a few moments to talk about some of the good things that are happening in his state .,Republican
i yield to the gentleman from kentucky .,Republican
i thank the gentleman from kentucky for talking with us a few moments about what he is seeing happening and his desire to see some changes take place here in the policies that we will make  the things that we will implement in this congress  in the 109th congress .,Republican
mr. speaker  one of the things that i do a lot and that i had the opportunity to do over the break is to visit with small business owners .,Republican
i heard repeatedly from them that what they do not want and what they do not need is more taxes  more regulation  and more government .,Republican
we hear them .,Republican
the republicans hear them .,Republican
this majority hears them .,Republican
we understand what they are saying .,Republican
unfortunately  i have a lot of colleagues who are not listening to these small business owners .,Republican
i think it is important to note  small businesses in america represent over 90 percent of all employers and employ half of all private sector employees .,Republican
they pay 44.3 percent of the total u.s. private payroll .,Republican
that is our small businesses and entrepreneurs that we have talked about today  the people that are starting businesses  that are creating so many of these jobs .,Republican
small businesses generate 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs growth annually .,Republican
that is why it is so important that we carry forth on this commitment to be certain that we have the right environment for an economic renaissance in this country .,Republican
small businesses are the nation 's economic engine  and republicans have worked to reduce their tax burden so that they have the ability to create more jobs .,Republican
we have passed legislation that will give them more affordable health care options for their employees  association health plans and health savings accounts .,Republican
republicans have passed legislation to stem the tide of frivolous lawsuits  and we are continuing to do more on the tort reform issues .,Republican
we are planning and continue to work daily on trade and opening foreign markets for american-made goods so that our employers in our local communities have access to markets around the globe  ways that they can place their products before a world that is ready to buy them .,Republican
and we are trying to make certain that manufacturers are not being treated unfairly and that they have the opportunity to be competitive in a global marketplace .,Republican
republicans want to pass a comprehensive energy policy so that america 's economic growth is not held hostage to foreign energy production .,Republican
we want to harness more of our domestic energy .,Republican
we believe excessive government growth in spending crowds businesses out of the marketplace .,Republican
we know that when there is a need  if government fills that need  then the private or not-for-profit sector does not move in and fill that need .,Republican
we know that the growth of government needs to be curtailed so that less of the taxpayers ' money is being required to pay for the government  so that taxpayers keep that money in their pocket .,Republican
reducing the size of government is what we have talked about over the past couple of weeks as we have talked about rooting out waste  fraud  and abuse and reducing the size of the federal government .,Republican
mr. speaker  we have a plan that will drive economic growth  that will continue to drive economic growth .,Republican
we have had 40 months of overall economic growth .,Republican
we would like to see another 40 months of economic growth and job creation for americans .,Republican
we have had 2.7 million jobs created in just under the past couple of years .,Republican
we have 21 months where we have seen manufacturing increases .,Republican
we had our last quarter of 2004 with 3.8 percent economic growth .,Republican
the fundamental difference between republicans and democrats is that we have a plan to continue to drive economic growth .,Republican
and all of our small business owners  myself included  we know the cost that regulation imposes and the importance of rolling back regulation .,Republican
among the top complaints that we receive from small business owners has to do with the federal tax code  the cost of compliance .,Republican
the gentleman from iowa ( mr.,Republican
king ) xz4002201 spoke to that earlier .,Republican
twenty-two cents of every single dollar of manufactured goods in this nation is spent in compliance .,Republican
that is an obstacle that we need to get rid of  and we are committed to working on that .,Republican
we know this tax code is overly complicated  it is time-consuming  and it is incredibly frustrating for millions of small business owners in this nation .,Republican
that is why republicans are committed to a code that is flatter  that is fairer  and absolutely is simpler not only for individuals but for our nation 's small businesses .,Republican
mr. speaker  all over we have got a plan .,Republican
it is the better plan .,Republican
and we know the problems that are facing our nation 's economy .,Republican
we know the problems that are facing this nation 's employers  whether they be small or whether they be large  whether they are small businesses or whether they are big business .,Republican
and  mr.,Republican
speaker  one thing that we know for sure in this 109th congress  we are committed to moving forward on commonsense reforms that will continue to work toward greater effectiveness and greater competitiveness for our nation 's economy .,Republican
mr. speaker  i congratulate the gentleman from utah ( mr.,Republican
bishop ) xz4000291 as a new member of the committee on rules for his work today on his first rule that he is bringing to the floor of the house .,Republican
today we are considering a rule that would allow for consideration of the reauthorization of the workforce investment act .,Republican
the workforce investment act  enacted in 1998  brought together some 60 federal job-training and retraining programs  and put them together and we created these one-stop shops all across america .,Republican
they are intended to be able to provide training and retraining for american workers who are out of work or workers who simply want to improve their skills so they can move up the economic ladder .,Republican
by and large  these one-stop shops have worked very well  but as we reauthorize this law  it is our obligation to take a look at what is working  what could work better  and as we bring this reauthorization forward  there are some important changes that we are bringing to the floor with it .,Republican
mr. speaker  we want to provide more flexibility for the local workforce boards to do their work by consolidating the funding stream .,Republican
we want to ensure that more of the funding that is available for this act goes down to the local county boards  or  in some cases  multiple county jurisdictions .,Republican
in this bill  we also renew the vocational programs for those who have disabilities  an important part of our workforce .,Republican
i think all of us know if we are going to be successful in the 21st century  that america has to do a better job of training and retraining our workforce .,Republican
the days of going to work for one employer and being there for most of your career are  by and large  over .,Republican
people are going to change jobs multiple times during their career  and we have to have available to them the kinds of services where they can improve their skills to take that new job of tomorrow .,Republican
the reauthorization program that we have today  i think is a good one .,Republican
there is one amendment that we will debate that we have had considerable debate on over the last several years in this congress and considered in the committee twice during the markup of this bill .,Republican
it is on the faith-based language .,Republican
members are going to hear an awful lot about it today  but let me give the parameters .,Republican
the 1964 civil rights act  the landmark legislation which prevented discrimination in america  allowed for one exception in hiring and that exception was granted to religious organizations where we grant them an exemption if they wished to only hire people of their own faith .,Republican
that is the law .,Republican
it has been the law since 1964 .,Republican
we believe that faith-based providers who may want to offer services  job training services or retraining services  ought not to be denied their rights under the 1964 civil rights act just because they want to help the neediest of the needy and help the poor improve their skills and get a job .,Republican
this is a great debate which has gone on for several years .,Republican
we allow faith-based providers in this bill to provide services without giving up their protections in the 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
some believe  and it is certainly their right to have a different opinion  believe that faith-based organizations  even though they have this right  ought to be forced to give it up in order to take federal funds to help the poorest of the poor .,Republican
now i would argue those who really do believe that is the case ought to go back and amend the 1964 civil rights act  title 7  and not try to do it in this bill .,Republican
but this provision  and again  we will have ample time to debate it later  i think this provision helps organizations who want to go out and help the needy in their community .,Republican
it gives them the tools to do it without having to set up a new organization  or denies them the ability and the rights that they have under the 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
i think that we have a fair rule before us .,Republican
i think it will provide for a very meaningful debate today on this reauthorization .,Republican
i would urge my colleagues to support it .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  as we stand here today we continue to see significant progress toward greater economic opportunity and prosperity across the country .,Republican
more than 2.7 million new jobs have been created over the last 17 months  and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2 percent  the lowest level since september 2001 .,Republican
our economy is strong and it is getting stronger .,Republican
the backbone of a strong economy is a well-trained and highly skilled workforce  and it is absolutely critical for workers to have the education and skills necessary to adapt to new opportunities and to move into higher wages .,Republican
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan agreed with this view when he testified before the committee on education and the workforce last year .,Republican
the chairman said  `` we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible have the opportunity to capture the benefits of the changing economy .,Republican
one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society.,Republican
'' chairman greenspan this morning testified before congress and talked about the need to do a better job with our education system and better training and retraining of american workers .,Republican
the bill before us  the job training improvement act  would achieve this objective by strengthening the nation 's job training system .,Republican
in 1998  congress established a system of one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and related employment services .,Republican
while these reforms have been generally successful  the workforce investment act system is still hampered by bureaucracy and duplication that prevents it from being as effective as it could be for workers and their families .,Republican
our bill includes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening our job training system and better engaging the business community to improve job training services .,Republican
our bill includes a number of reforms .,Republican
first  requiring state and local workforce investment boards to ensure the job training programs reflect the employment needs in local areas .,Republican
secondly  allowing training for currently employed workers so employees can upgrade their skills and avoid layoffs .,Republican
third  encouraging the highest caliber providers  including community colleges  to offer training through the one-stop system  and leveraging other public and private resources to increase training and opportunities .,Republican
the bill also includes other important reforms .,Republican
first  it consolidates the three adult wia training programs  giving states and local communities greater flexibility and enabling more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services .,Republican
in addition  it targets 70 percent of the youth grant funds to out-of-school youth  an underserved population that faces significant challenges in finding meaningful employment .,Republican
the bill includes a proposal passed by the house last year introduced by the gentleman from nevada ( mr.,Republican
porter ) xz4003240 to create personal reemployment accounts of up to $ 3  000 to help unemployed americans purchase job training and other employment-related services  such as child care  transportation services and housing assistance  giving them the flexibility they need in order to gain meaningful employment .,Republican
in addition  it includes the president 's community college proposal to strengthen the partnership between local businesses  community colleges  and the local one-stop delivery system .,Republican
later today  we will consider an amendment from my colleague from virginia to strip the faith-based provisions from this bill  an amendment that would deny faith-based providers their rights under the historic 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
when we considered this bill in committee  we twice rejected it on a bipartisan basis  and i urge all members to vote against it today .,Republican
the 1964 civil rights act made clear that when faith-based groups hire employees on a religious basis  it can exercise the group 's civil rights liberties and not discriminate under federal law .,Republican
in 1987  the supreme court unanimously upheld this right .,Republican
as my colleagues can see from the chart that i have next to me  former president bill clinton signed four laws allowing faith-based groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive those federal funds .,Republican
those four laws are the 1996 welfare reform law ; the 1998 community services block grant act ; the 2000 community renewal tax relief act ; and the 2000 substance abuse and mental health services administration act  all allowing faith-based providers to preserve their rights under the 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
our nation 's faith-based institutions have a proven track record in meeting the training and counseling needs of our citizens .,Republican
why would we want to deny them the opportunity to help in federal job training efforts ?,Republican
president bush repeated this call to empower faith-based providers both during his state of the union address and again yesterday .,Republican
i can think of no better place to start than to protect the rights of faith-based groups who are willing to lend a helping hand in providing job training and other critical social services to the most needy of our citizens .,Republican
i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
mckeon ) xz4002670 for his work in putting this bill together  a bill that is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of groups  including the u.s. chamber of commerce  the national association of counties  the national association of workforce boards  the national workforce association  the coalition to preserve religious freedom and the salvation army  amongst others .,Republican
we are part of a dynamic economy that is constantly creating new and different types of jobs  so the knowledge and skills of each job seeker is absolutely critical in determining their success or failure .,Republican
if we are going to help them succeed  then strengthening our job training programs is essential .,Republican
the bill  i believe  accomplishes that goal .,Republican
unfortunately  the only plan that my colleagues on the other side have put forward to address the needs of american workers is the status quo .,Republican
their plan fails to reduce duplication and inefficiency  it fails to give states and local communities more flexibility  and it fails to take advantage of the positive role that faith-based institutions play in our communities and the success they have in providing critical social services to those most in need .,Republican
mr. chairman  the status quo is no plan at all .,Republican
i ask my colleagues to support the underlying bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i want to thank the gentleman from texas for raising this issue .,Republican
data on young adults participating in adult education programs is important information for our committee as well as for the adult education programs and for school districts to keep in mind as we work to raise our high school completion rates .,Republican
and it is my understanding that this is information that the department already collects but has not been a focus in program reporting .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
mckeon ) xz4002670  the author of the bill  the chairman of the subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr.,Republican
hayworth ) xz4001730 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
in closing  my friends on the other side have had numerous objections to provisions in h.r.,Republican
27 .,Republican
they have a right to do so and i expect it will be warmly discussed in the ensuing discussion of the bill itself .,Republican
i believe strongly in the ability of our states  governors  local boards  workforce boards  to be creative and innovative .,Republican
there is no omniscient power that we have here .,Republican
people can think for themselves in other parts of this country .,Republican
and the essence of our government demands that we give them the opportunity to succeed without the benevolent help of the federal government .,Republican
our job  might i remind my colleagues  is to make sure the micaelas of the world never slip through the cracks .,Republican
i believe  and i have confidence in the ability of local governments to be creative and effective  and i think so does h.r.,Republican
27 .,Republican
what we have today is a confusing patchwork of employment  training services .,Republican
the duplication of those reduces the amount of money we get to use to help micaelas .,Republican
many amendments that we will be discussing on the floor have also been discussed in committee .,Republican
a lot of other amendments were heard in the committee .,Republican
this was fully discussed in committee and voted upon .,Republican
may i just  in closing  ask us not to lose sight that the goal is service and how to provide training for people which is given without any precondition .,Republican
hiring practices that are protected by existing law are that  protected by existing law .,Republican
if we feel there is a problem with that  then we should attack the existing law  and there are venues to do that .,Republican
this is not the venue in this particular bill .,Republican
faith-based institutions out there  which are not rich  are still nevertheless effective .,Republican
they care .,Republican
they have the same goal as we do .,Republican
our goal should be to try to join hands to help all the micaelas in the world solve the problem of employment  retraining  and servicing  not to try to change our friends in other particular ways but to join together on a common front  in a common effort  to help people  not to harm people .,Republican
mr. speaker  in closing  i urge adoption of the rule and the underlying legislation .,Republican
mr. chairman  again i want to thank the gentleman for his work on this issue .,Republican
i will continue to work with him and the department to ensure that we have the necessary information to carefully monitor the participation of high school-aged students in adult education programs .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from puerto rico ( mr.,Republican
fortun 6o ) .,Republican
mr. fortun 6o .,Republican
mr. chairman  back in 1998  congress enacted the workforce investment act  which established a system for a one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and other employment-related services .,Republican
while these reforms have largely been a success  the system is still hampered by inefficiency  duplication  and unnecessary bureaucracy .,Republican
the bill that we are approving today aims to strengthen training services for job seekers accomplishes these goals in several ways : particularly by streamlining bureaucracy and eliminating duplication ; consolidating the three adult wia training programs  giving states and local communities greater flexibility  and enabling more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services ; removing arbitrary barriers that prevent individuals from accessing job training services immediately ; strengthening partnerships between local businesses  communities colleges and the local one-stop delivery system ; enhancing vocational rehabilitation to help individuals with disabilities ; and improving allocation and literacy for adults to ensure they gain the knowledge and skills necessary to find employment  including language proficiency .,Republican
i want to thank the chairman on the committee for adopting two amendments i have introduced to enhance further employability of the limited english proficient calculation by providing necessary skills  training and english language instruction .,Republican
i believe this will help tremendously  especially the hispanic populations throughout the country .,Republican
i believe that the backbone of a strong economy and a strong society is a well-trained and highly-skilled workforce .,Republican
the bill on the floor today is an excellent source to achieve that goal .,Republican
this bill includes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening our nation 's job training system and better engaging the business community to improve job training services .,Republican
it accomplishes this by requiring state and local workforce investment boards to ensure the job training programs reflect the employment needs in local areas ; also allowing training for currently employed workers so employers can upgrade workers ' skills and avoid layoffs ; encouraging the highest caliber providers  including community colleges  to offer training through the one-stop system ; leveraging other public and private resources to increase training opportunities ; and increasing connections to economic development programs .,Republican
the bill reauthorizes the rehabilitation act of 1993  the primary federal program designed to assist individuals with disabilities to prepare for  obtain and retain employment to live independently ; and furthermore  it includes transition services for students with disabilities moving from secondary education into post-secondary activities that can only be determined as a possible alternative to address the needs of those in special needs .,Republican
i am convinced that h.r.,Republican
27 is a valuable tool to achieve that goal we all have set our minds to .,Republican
and that is none other than creating a better and strong economy and society that will be prepared to compete in a changing and demanding new world that rises as we speak .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  what we have before us is the reauthorization of the workforce investment act .,Republican
it was first passed in 1998 .,Republican
these one-stop centers that have been created all over the country to help the people gain skills and to increase their skills are a critical part of what we need to do if we are going to have a successful economy over the next 10  20 and even 50 years .,Republican
what we have done in this reauthorization is tried to make these one-stop centers work even better .,Republican
we believe that by consolidating the three separate funding streams  three different sets of employees  three different sets of books  we can gain more flexibility for the local workforce boards and thereby freeing up more dollars to be used to actually train workers .,Republican
we believe strongly that the youth services money here ought to be directed for the most part to out of school youth  a population that is vastly underserved and we do that in this bill .,Republican
we also believe that faith-based providers  especially in large urban centers  can provide a very necessary outreach to help those who are really needy have an opportunity to get the kind of training and retraining they need to become productive members of our society .,Republican
i think what we have here is a very good bill .,Republican
and while my friends on the other side of the aisle have some disagreement  i think all of us understand that by and large  this is a good program  that the bill before us is worth the support of my colleagues and i would ask them to do that .,Republican
mr. chairman  i want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding .,Republican
i pledge to work with her and other interested members of the new york delegation during conference on this legislation to identify and remedy any governance problems which new york may have under this bill .,Republican
however  it is not clear that the language that the gentlewoman offered in committee that is included in s. 9 fixes the problem in new york and could have other unintended consequences in new york and other states .,Republican
so my goal is to ensure that the mandatory partners contribute to the cost of the one-stop infrastructure without causing constitutional problems for states .,Republican
and as i suggested  i will continue to work with the gentlewoman to achieve this .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the gentleman 's amendment and yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
mr. chairman  the amendment that is being offered by my friend  the gentleman from michigan ( mr.,Republican
kildee ) xz4002160  would strike all of the positive reforms for youth that are included in h.r.,Republican
27 .,Republican
under current law  funds for the wia youth program are spread too thinly  as they fund programs that both serve in-school and out-of-school youth .,Republican
in the white house  the disadvantaged youth task force has proposed targeted federal youth training funds to serve the most in need and to reduce the duplication of services amongst federal programs .,Republican
there are a large number of programs today designed to deal with in-school  at-risk children  and there is really only one program in wia that is targeted at out-of-school youth .,Republican
what we tried to do in this bill was to strike a balance by requiring that 70 percent of the youth program funds go to out-of-school youth  a population that is by and large ignored and that i think these funds ought to be targeted to .,Republican
we do allow the local workforce boards to use up to 30 percent of their programs for in-school youth ; but there are other programs  a half a dozen other programs  targeted at these at-risk children who are in school .,Republican
so as a way of trying to bring more synergy to an effort to help out-of-school youth  i think the language we have in the bill strikes the right balance .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume just to correct the record .,Republican
the gentlewoman who just spoke says that we eliminated a preference for veterans in this bill .,Republican
the fact is that there is a preference for veterans written into the law .,Republican
that has not changed at all .,Republican
secondly  the gentlewoman said there are block grants in the underlying bill .,Republican
there are no block grants .,Republican
as a matter of fact  the targeting of funds to the local workforce boards in this bill is more structured than it is today under current law  so that at least 75 percent of the funds available back to the states must go to the local workforce investment boards .,Republican
lastly  the gentlewoman said that we have discrimination in this bill .,Republican
i would just remind the gentlewoman that when our predecessors wrote the 1964 civil rights act  they recognized in title vii that religious organizations ought to be protected in their hiring so that they would not be required to hire anybody that shows up  but could  if they wanted to  only hire those people within their faith .,Republican
now  if people want to disagree with title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  they certainly have that right .,Republican
they may go to the committee on the judiciary and change that law  but let us not try to do it in this bill .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
price ) xz4006261  a member of the committee ) .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 30 seconds  the balance of my time  to my friend  the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr.,Republican
tierney ) xz4004070  who i know has been pressed for time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself 30 seconds .,Republican
title vii of the 1964 civil rights act explicitly says that religious organizations in their hiring can hire people of their own faith .,Republican
period .,Republican
that is what it says .,Republican
it does not say whether you take federal money or you do not take federal money .,Republican
it says that a religious organization can take religion into account in terms of their hiring .,Republican
period .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr.,Republican
souder ) xz4003850 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia .,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms.,Republican
foxx ) xz4006430 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana ( mr.,Republican
jindal ) xz4006340 .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentlewoman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i reserve the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  so the debate here boils down to one of two issues  you believe that if these faith-based organizations want to participate in these programs that they have to give up their rights under the 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
we believe and the majority of this house has believed on a number of occasions as we have had this vote  that faith-based organizations who want to help the neediest of the needy should in fact be able to have their rights under the 1964 civil rights act .,Republican
it is just as simple as that .,Republican
so i would ask my colleagues as they look at this bill and look at this amendment to support the work that we have done  to allow these groups to participate .,Republican
they do good work .,Republican
there is no reason why that they can not partner with the federal government to help us in our effort to help the neediest of the needy  and to help improve the prospects for job training and retraining to help all americans participate in the 21st century economy and give them a chance to succeed at the american dream .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask my colleagues to vote against the scott amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from puerto rico ( mr.,Republican
fortun 6o ) .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit .,Republican
mr. speaker  let us tell the truth about what has happened in job creation in america .,Republican
over the last 17 months  2.7 million new jobs have been created in america .,Republican
our economy is strong and our economy is getting stronger .,Republican
if we look at the underlying bill that we have before us  veterans have a preference to services above all others .,Republican
what the gentleman from michigan proposes here is a brand new program similar to a trade adjustment program that provides up to 2 years of unemployment-type benefits and provides unlimited access to training .,Republican
but the fact is that unemployed workers have access today  people coming back from iraq who are unemployed have access to services  and those who may have their jobs lost through outsourcing have  in fact  access to services .,Republican
but what also happens under the gentleman 's amendment is that they get a preference in this bill .,Republican
the gentleman creates a new preference here above other types of people who may have lost their jobs .,Republican
the underlying bill  in fact  will provide more services to more unemployed workers and workers who want to increase their skills who may not be unemployed .,Republican
but when we look at this  this is a new program .,Republican
this is an authorization .,Republican
there is no appropriation .,Republican
we all know it will probably take 2 to 5 years for this type of program to be implemented .,Republican
the fact is i think it is a cruel hoax on those who may be unemployed  who may fall into one of these categories to think that they are going to be eligible for unemployment-type assistance or be eligible for unlimited training when  in fact  there is no appropriation and the fact is the program will take years to implement .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to recommit and support the underlying bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in support of h.r.,Republican
27  the job training improvement act  which will reauthorize the workforce investment act ( wia ) -- programs which provide job training for youths  veterans  and seasonal and migrant workers .,Republican
for the past six years wia has offered a `` one-stop delivery system '' through which job-seekers have access to labor market information  job counseling  and job training .,Republican
in addition  they have access to numerous other federal programs that provide services for job seekers .,Republican
with facilities in wilmington  newark  dover and georgetown  the `` one-stop delivery system '' in delaware has proved to be an efficient tool in training individuals for the workforce .,Republican
for example  in delaware all of our centers are fully equipped with : internet ready computers  interactive cd-rom tutorials  fax machine to send resume and cover letters to perspective employers  copy machine  telephone resource center with career manuals including reference books .,Republican
delaware also runs an internet site where applicants can post resumes  as well as to search a comprehensive database of job openings .,Republican
applicants can also allow job scout to search the system for you automatically track wages and trends  training locations and funding available .,Republican
it also offers bus schedules  links to newspaper classified ads  child care and related information through the family and workplace connection .,Republican
the purpose of highlighting the program in delaware is to provide a real life example of useful it is to have services in one central place .,Republican
the bill before us today builds on the efficiency of the `` one-stop delivery '' model by streamlining unnecessary bureaucracy  eliminating duplication  strengthening resource allocation  and improving accountability .,Republican
i am pleased that we are able to make reforms that build upon successes  and that will ultimately enhance the ability of adults to access services that lead to employment .,Republican
i would also like to briefly touch upon the services that are provided for youth under this bill .,Republican
under this legislation youth between the ages of 16 and 24 are eligible for a variety of services geared toward graduating high school or gaining the skills necessary for employment .,Republican
the importance of these services can not be overstated to these young adults .,Republican
with that  i thank the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
mckeon )  and urge my colleagues to support h.r.,Republican
27 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .,Republican
i urge the body to adopt this rule and to pass the bill .,Republican
i will be addressing just one particular topic which has been controversial in committee discussions and will be the subject of an amendment later on  and that is turning the clock back on the civil rights act of 1964 and changing what it says .,Republican
those who are opposed to this bill on that ground believe that somehow it is wrong to allow religious institutions to receive federal funds for programs that benefit the public at large  are not restricted to people of particular faith but are operated by organizations that are religiously based .,Republican
i have listened carefully to the debate in the committee .,Republican
we have had this same debate several times in committee .,Republican
i have yet to understand precisely what the objections are  but it seems that opponents are afraid of two things : one  that this provision in the bill somehow will allow these organizations to discriminate on other grounds in their hiring  which is  first  contrary to the civil rights act  and second  i would say religious organizations are the least likely to discriminate on the basis of race or any of the other forbidden categories .,Republican
the other objection appears to be that somehow these churches are going to use this federal money to try to proselytize  to get people in these programs and then they will say  okay  now is n't this wonderful  you should join this church .,Republican
i would like to say  that is also not true .,Republican
it just does not happen .,Republican
i can speak from my personal experience .,Republican
when my wife and i moved to grand rapids  michigan  in 1966 to take on a new position  we looked for a church .,Republican
in fact  we spent 3 months trying out different churches  looking  trying to find a certain something : we wanted a church in the inner city because we wanted to be able to contribute to solving the problems of the city of grand rapids  particularly in the inner city .,Republican
and so we joined eastern avenue christian reformed church because of its location and because of the attitude of its people .,Republican
they worked very hard in the community .,Republican
as an example  they established a community center .,Republican
there was none at that time either federally funded  state funded  or city funded .,Republican
the church stepped in and started it .,Republican
it was on the top story of a ramshackle building which housed a small convenience store in the lower floor .,Republican
it grew slowly at first  but then took off .,Republican
today it is a large community center  one of the best  if not the best  in the city .,Republican
they purchased a school which was being abandoned  filled up that school  and they now have just successfully completed a $ 2.5 million capital drive to add on to their facilities and improve them .,Republican
our church started that .,Republican
we did have and still largely do have religious restrictions on the hiring of individuals  but the facility serves all people in that community .,Republican
it has brought in medical care workers of all faiths to work and provide medical care and dental care for the recipients in that community .,Republican
we started a housing program which turned into the inner city christian federation  and we spun off this organization as well as baxter community center  but they are still largely faith-based organizations .,Republican
iccf  the inner city christian federation  developed housing programs  and they had built many houses before habitat for humanity started in our community ; but iccf has built and remodeled more houses than almost any organization within the city that i am aware of .,Republican
again  it is faith-based .,Republican
the employees are hired partially on the basis of their faith and their commitment to serving in the inner city and often work for less pay than they could get elsewhere .,Republican
our church  not our individual congregation  but our denomination started a mental health institution  pine rest  years ago because the people of our church and of our community were not getting adequate mental care .,Republican
today it is one of the largest mental health hospitals in our nation .,Republican
it serves many people of different faiths and of no faith  but it is a faith-based institution because their treatment modalities are based  to a large extent  on our beliefs about the nature of people and their interaction with each other .,Republican
it has been very successful .,Republican
it has received millions upon millions of dollars of aid from the federal government  from the state through community mental health funds and from the local community .,Republican
no one has ever said a word about this  that using federal money for this is improper .,Republican
the reason is simply that pine rest provides services that really are unequaled anywhere else .,Republican
and so they have received federal dollars through medicaid and through medicare  and state dollars through community mental health .,Republican
it is an outstanding operation .,Republican
then  finally  something we have ongoing in our church right now .,Republican
every saturday  i wish you could visit our church ; you would see people of all races  all colors  all faiths walking in the church basement which we have stocked with food that we have collected from different stores  warehouses and so forth : produce  baked goods  and many different types of perishable food .,Republican
we have purchased a truck to go around and collect this on fridays .,Republican
and saturday morning anyone from that city can walk in with no test of their faith  no means test  they can just walk in and say  i need some groceries  and they go through the line .,Republican
we charge them roughly 10 cents on the dollar because we think it is a good thing for them to feel they have bought something ; but a family of four can buy a week 's worth of groceries for about $ 10 .,Republican
that is a good deal .,Republican
it is staffed by people from our church and from other churches  and it is a very successful operation .,Republican
if we adopt the scott amendment  which we will be discussing later  we simply could not do that .,Republican
there is one other factor here as well  and that is every church that i am aware of does not have a surplus of money .,Republican
the people that they hire have to do many different jobs .,Republican
that is true in our church as well .,Republican
we have hired individuals who work in the church .,Republican
those individuals not only operate programs such as the food program  or getting community centers started  but they also have duties within the church and by necessity  and clearly within the intent of the civil rights act  they are performing religious duties .,Republican
a church can not go out and afford to hire a different person to run each different program .,Republican
you have to be multifaceted to be on the staff of a church  and that is precisely what we have in our church .,Republican
for these reasons  and many others i could enumerate  i urge the congress to pass this rule and this bill  and to defeat the scott amendment  so that churches and faith-based organizations of other sorts can continue to do their good work for the people of this country without fear of their programs being damaged because they would have to hire additional personnel who do not have a faith compatible with the organization .,Republican
i believe the system as we have it now  and have had it since the 1964 civil rights act  has worked  it has worked well  and i urge that we keep it that way and not adopt the scott amendment .,Republican
mr. chairman  will the gentleman yield ?,Republican
mr. chairman  i rise in strong support of h.r.,Republican
27 and thank the gentleman from ohio for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor  the job training improvement act of 2005  which i introduced to strengthen and reauthorize the nation 's job training system as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs .,Republican
job training programs must be responsive to the needs of the workforce and improving them is critical .,Republican
in today 's knowledge-based economy  we need to equip americans with the skills they need to find a new or better job and quickly return to the workforce .,Republican
one of the hallmarks of wia is that in order to encourage the development of comprehensive systems that improve services to both employers and job seekers  local services are provided through a one-stop delivery system .,Republican
the one-stop centers serve as the front line in helping job seekers return to the workforce .,Republican
at the one-stop centers  assistance ranges from core services such as job search and placement assistance  access to job listings and an initial assessment of skills and needs  to intensive services such as comprehensive assessments and case management and  if needed  occupational skills training .,Republican
over the last 3 years  i have met with local workforce development leaders  businesses  the administration  researchers  and others to examine how we can improve our federal job training system .,Republican
while the workforce investment act of 1998 made dramatic reforms to the nation 's workforce system  i learned that further refinements were necessary to ensure state and local officials have the flexibility they need to effectively target resources toward the unique needs of their communities .,Republican
the job training improvement act builds upon wia to make it more demand-driven and flexible while reducing unnecessary duplication and inefficiency .,Republican
h.r.,Republican
27 will help strengthen and improve the nation 's locally driven  business-led workforce investment system to help states and localities ensure workers get the training they need to find good jobs .,Republican
for example  the bill streamlines the current wia funding in order to provide more efficient and results-oriented services and programs by combining the adult  dislocated  and employment service funding streams into one funding stream .,Republican
this will eliminate duplication in service delivery and administrative functions that remain in the system  improving services for individuals .,Republican
the bill also ensures the financial contribution of the mandatory partners in the one-stop centers while at the same time it increases the service integration among the partner programs .,Republican
this will improve access to services through the one-stop delivery system for special populations  such as individuals with disabilities .,Republican
in order to ensure greater responsiveness to local area needs and strengthen the private sector 's role  the bill simplifies the local and state governance processes .,Republican
one-stop partner programs will no longer be required to have a seat on the local boards .,Republican
this will provide for greater representation and influence by local business representatives .,Republican
currently  they are frequently frustrated that they are not able to connect with or access resources from the local boards .,Republican
mr. chairman  i had a couple of my good friends  constituents in my district  that lost their jobs in the defense industry .,Republican
they came up and thanked me for the help they received from wia .,Republican
they were able to get vouchers .,Republican
one of them went on to become a school teacher  one a worker in the computer industry .,Republican
this bill works .,Republican
the new bill that we are passing today will make it better  more efficient and help the people to really get the services they need so we can continue to have the job growth that we have been enjoying the last few months here in the country .,Republican
i support this strongly .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr.,Republican
regula ) xz4003340 .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from nebraska ( mr.,Republican
osborne ) xz4003030  a member of the committee .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from nevada ( mr.,Republican
porter ) xz4003240  a member of the committee  vice chairman of the subcommittee .,Republican
mr. chairman  although i do not oppose the amendment  i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition .,Republican
mr. chairman  i am happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr.,Republican
price ) xz4006261  a new member of the committee .,Republican
mr. chairman  i would like to particularly thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( mr.,Republican
mckeon ) xz4002670  subcommittee chairman  for this bill .,Republican
from my perspective this is a good bill .,Republican
and i think there are several points i would like to make .,Republican
first of all  it consolidates programs and creates efficiencies .,Republican
it gives state and local officials more flexibility  which is always important .,Republican
and the $ 3  000 reemployment accounts to purchase needed services to ensure reemployment seem to me to be a good idea because ofttimes when a person is trying to get back on their feet  they need to have money to pay for child care .,Republican
they need transportation .,Republican
it allows them to get reestablished  and we think this is certainly very helpful .,Republican
and then it also allows faith-based organizations to offer job training service .,Republican
we think this is important .,Republican
i would like to amplify on that just a little bit .,Republican
number one  faith-based organizations often provide services more efficiently than state or federal agencies .,Republican
the salvation army  catholic charities  jewish federation are all extremely efficient and they are very cost effective .,Republican
secondly  faith-based organizations often go where others will not go or do not go .,Republican
in inner cities  and sometimes our rural areas  we find that they are very effective .,Republican
faith-based organizations are by law allowed to hire employees to provide services which conform to the mission of the faith-based organization .,Republican
this right was affirmed by the 1964 civil rights act and the 1987 supreme court decision  corporation of the presiding bishop versus amos .,Republican
so we think there is ample legal justification for this .,Republican
number four  faith-based organization employees must often wear many hats .,Republican
for instance  a music director at a church may also work at the job training center in the afternoon .,Republican
a sunday school superintendent may also run a head start program at the faith-based organization .,Republican
so it is unreasonable and contrary to establish law to force faith-based organizations to hire employees who do not share the faith-based organization 's mission .,Republican
we think this makes perfect sense .,Republican
this is a good bill and i urge support for it .,Republican
mr. speaker  i rise in opposition to this amendment .,Republican
the 1964 civil rights act explicitly protects the rights of religious organizations to take religion into account in their hiring practices .,Republican
in fact  the civil rights act made clear that when faith-based organizations hire employees on a religious basis  it is an exercise of the organization 's civil liberties and does not constitute discrimination under federal law .,Republican
the writers of that legislation understood that a church  a synagogue  a mosque all operate as distinctly religious organizations .,Republican
they are  therefore  protected under the first amendment 's right to the free exercise of religion .,Republican
why are we being asked today  then  to approve an amendment that revokes the constitutional right of faith-based communities to practice their religions freely ?,Republican
this amendment would revoke the constitutionally protected right of faith-based groups to maintain their religious nature and character through those they hire .,Republican
by denying the rights of religious organizations to hire according to their principles  this amendment declares war between the government and faith-based organizations  it cuts services for people in need  it eliminates the role of faith-based organizations in our government efforts to help .,Republican
i doubt that the gentleman from virginia would support an amendment forcing him to hire staff who oppose his values and priorities as a legislator .,Republican
why then are we being asked to call it discriminatory when a christian or muslim charity wants to consider the beliefs of potential employees before hiring them ?,Republican
such practices have been upheld by the united states supreme court .,Republican
if this amendment passes  we might as well revisit the civil rights act itself  since we would be rewriting it today .,Republican
faith-based providers can not be expected to sustain their religious missions without the ability to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices of their faith .,Republican
the success of any organization is having everyone on board with its essential principles and vision .,Republican
the civil rights act secures that right  the supreme court protected it  and we should follow suit .,Republican
this amendment should be defeated .,Republican
mr. chairman  there are towns and neighborhoods across america that have tough problems  social crises  that desperately need to be addressed .,Republican
fortunately  there are many organizations in those communities that want to help  and they offer unique and innovative solutions to some of our most challenging needs .,Republican
we must open doors for them and help them help our neighbors .,Republican
that begins by removing the barriers that unnecessarily stand in their way .,Republican
it is essential that we recognize the importance of government working with faith-based providers to help society .,Republican
these organizations are a central part of the fabric of communities across america and we need to ensure that we are removing any obstacles that stand in the way of their ability to help .,Republican
faith-based organizations have a federally-protected right to maintain their religious nature and character through those they hire .,Republican
organizations willing to serve their communities by participating in federal programs should not be forced to give up that right .,Republican
we must pass this legislation with a clear message from congress to our faith-based leaders : we need your service and we want to assist you in delivering for us and for the most vulnerable in our society .,Republican
i urge my colleagues to vote against any amendment that would remove the important religious freedom protections these organizations need and deserve .,Republican
mr. chairman  i ask unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume .,Republican
i just want to say to the gentlewoman from rochester  new york ( ms.,Republican
slaughter ) that every single member of this institution  democrat and republican alike  is very concerned and focused on the integrity of this institution ; and i believe that that is something which is an extraordinarily high priority for all of us .,Republican
i believe that the package that we have coming before us is one which addresses many of the concerns that frankly were raised by the gentlewoman from new york ( ms.,Republican
slaughter ) .,Republican
mr. speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and leading us in this important subject matter .,Republican
i appreciate the opportunity to say a few words .,Republican
before getting to the economy  i want to add some remarks to those of the gentlewoman from tennessee 's discussion with regard to the middle east .,Republican
i would like to paint this image in the mind of the people in the country .,Republican
and that is that as we see people demonstrating in the streets of lebanon  when they have made the pledge that they are not leaving the public arena until they are a government governed by themselves and that they are a free people  that magnificent display that is going on in lebanon today  as i watched that  i looked back through my mind 's eye and i asked myself where i have experienced anything like that before ; where i have seen anything like that in history .,Republican
it takes me back to the square in prague  back in the early 1990s  after the berlin wall came down .,Republican
that was about november 9 when the wall came down  and it echoed into about 1990  right before the czechs went to the square and stood there with their keys and rattled their keys in the air .,Republican
they stood for freedom  until today they are a free people .,Republican
that miracle of freedom that echoed across eastern europe in that time was not something anyone predicted .,Republican
yet our president stood just outside this capitol building on january 20 and gave his second inaugural address  and even the liberal news media understood there was a bush doctrine  and that was the doctrine of freedom .,Republican
he said in that address : `` if you stand for freedom  we stand with you.,Republican
'' today  we stand with the lebanese people  we stand with the syrians  we stand with the iranians  and we stand with the saudis .,Republican
we stand with all people on this planet that yearn for freedom .,Republican
another thing that has happened there is that the fear factor has disappeared in lebanon .,Republican
when the fear factor disappeared  the people could freely stand in the streets .,Republican
when that fear factor can disappear in iran  in syria  in saudi arabia  and around the middle east  they can also come to the streets .,Republican
maybe before then .,Republican
when that day comes  we will no longer see the habitat that breeds terror  and we will be able to actually stand here today and define a victory in the war on terror  and that is the absence of the habitat that breeds terrorists .,Republican
and that is freedom .,Republican
but to our economy  which is the discussion tonight .,Republican
i characterize it a couple of ways and add to the gentlewoman 's discussion  and that is that our jobs growth in this country has been going on at such a torrid pace that we will soon  within the next 3 months  reach the level of over the last 2 years having had job growth of 1.5 million jobs a year .,Republican
that is 1 1/2 million jobs a year .,Republican
that is an amazingly fast growth  3.8 percent growth as the gentlewoman said  but that in the face of the trial lawyers skimming 3 percent off the top .,Republican
and that study tells us that they take the first money .,Republican
they are standing there taking the first money off our economy .,Republican
if we want to grow at 3 1/2 percent  just to sustain the growth we need in our infrastructure and to meet the needs of a growing population  then we have to make up for that 3 percent that goes off the top because of the litigation in this country that is rampant .,Republican
we took steps in this congress to rein some of that in .,Republican
we sent it over to the senate  where this year they heard us and sent it to the president  and he signed the litigation reform legislation  which will make a difference and make it easier to sustain that kind of growth .,Republican
homeownership is at an all-time high .,Republican
i think it would compete with anywhere in the world  at 69.2 percent .,Republican
that is 69.2 percent .,Republican
seven out of ten people you meet on the street live in a home they own or are making payments on .,Republican
not a rented home  but an owned home .,Republican
what pride in ownership .,Republican
and what that does for sending the roots down into our economy and society and keeping our children at home  all of those things are a plus that show up in the bottom line .,Republican
inflation is in check .,Republican
personal income is up 8.6 percent .,Republican
that is so much in the last year that it scares me a little bit  being a 28-year employer ; thinking that if personal income is up 8.6 percent  then i would have to be giving my employees a raise of 8.6 percent every year  which is a pretty torrid pace as well to keep up with employment .,Republican
earlier we heard on the floor some remarks that we have a lot of problems with the trade imbalance  and i will not deny we have a trade imbalance .,Republican
in fact  a year ago it was minus $ 503 billion a year .,Republican
the last announcement came out  the annual report came out february 10  and that was a minus $ 617.7 billion in imbalance in trade .,Republican
so that is about a 20 percent increase in the negative balance of trade that we have .,Republican
some of those things work out good for our consumers .,Republican
you can afford to buy a winter coat for your little girl cheaper than you could before .,Republican
but we can not go on forever letting foreign interests own u.s. assets and holding them for collateral .,Republican
so we need to work this thing back to correct the balance of trade  but it is not something that will be done with a policy that says  well  we are concerned about sweat shop labor in el salvador or those kinds of issues that are essentially out of control .,Republican
what is in our control in this congress are our tax policy  regulatory policy  and that is what we need to focus on .,Republican
that is why i  years ago  in fact 25 years ago  came to the position and the conclusion that we needed to do some real tax reform .,Republican
now  we have done good things with the jobs and growth act  and they were the right decisions to bring us back from the bursting of the dot-com bubble that happened about 7 or 8 months before the president was inaugurated the first time ; and then  of course  the september 11 attacks .,Republican
i will argue that those two blows to our economy  coupled together  were the greatest blows  the most severe blows ever to the economy of this country ; yet we have recovered .,Republican
the stock market is back and all these statistics are up .,Republican
but we can do more  and we can do better .,Republican
mr. speaker  we can do better because there is another level  another destiny for the united states of america .,Republican
we are reaching for that destiny to inspire all people in the world to reach for freedom and liberty and being able to make their own investments and control their own destiny economically  but we can also set a tax policy that ceases to punish the productivity in america .,Republican
today  today every day when people go to work and punch the time clock or make the sales calls or throw that bale of hay  uncle sam stands there with his hand out with the first lien on everyone 's labor  on the productivity of america  on your investment interest and on your labor .,Republican
ronald reagan once said what you tax you get less of .,Republican
so us  in our wisdom  we tax productivity in america instead of consumption .,Republican
i suggest we eliminate the irs  the tax code that goes with it  and transfer all of this over to a national sales tax  a consumption tax  a fair tax  h.r.,Republican
5 and tax consumption  take all tax off of production and get uncle sam out of the way  standing there at the time clock getting his first and the worker getting his later  and change this whole attitude .,Republican
productivity will go up in america .,Republican
the irs right now is a trillion dollar drag on an $ 11 trillion economy when we add the cost of funding them  enforcing them  and the disincentives that are in place that people decide i am not going to make that sales call  i am not going to do that extra overtime  i am not going to make that investment in that farm or industrial factory because the tax burden is too high .,Republican
if we take the tax off all productivity  everybody gets the money they earned in their paycheck .,Republican
take-home pay goes up 56 percent under a national sales tax  and items on the shelf  their price goes down by an average of 22 percent because there is an imputed cost in everything that is sold .,Republican
businesses that provide goods for sales have to impute the cost of the federal tax in that item .,Republican
that is an average of 22 percent .,Republican
so  for example  if there is a japanese-made mazda that is imported from japan sitting on the dealer 's lot at $ 30  000  and pick your american brand sitting on the other side of the street with a $ 30  000 sticker price  we remove the federal tax that is imputed into the american made because it is imputed in the japanese made overseas .,Republican
we will see that $ 30  000 american-made car go down to $ 23  600  and the japanese car is still at $ 30  000 .,Republican
by the time we add the sales tax back in  the american car is at $ 30  400 or so  but the japanese car is around $ 39  000 .,Republican
we have approximately a $ 9  000 advantage on those two vehicles of equivalent value that were selling competitively at $ 30  000 each .,Republican
we change the tax policy  and competition drives the price out of the american made and now we have an advantage to market american goods .,Republican
mr. speaker  that is one of the ways that we can address this imbalance of trade because we will build more products here .,Republican
if we sell more of our products here  that means the jobs that produce them are here .,Republican
if we import less from foreign countries  that means the jobs that produce those imports are going to have to be producing exports to go to other countries .,Republican
we can repair this balance of trade with a national sales tax  a fair tax .,Republican
we can change this $ 617.7 billion of red ink to a plus number  and while we are doing that  we remove the penalty for savings and investment .,Republican
so the capital investment the gentlewoman talked about that really is a great indicator of where our economy is going  capital investment will not be punished .,Republican
form the capital  and we will see capital go into technology  research and development  higher ed  all of the things that improve the productivity of the american worker .,Republican
by the way  we must improve the productivity of the american worker .,Republican
we are seeing industrial equipment go overseas as well .,Republican
and as we see that punch press or lathe going to a developing country and they train their workers how to use that equipment  we will never get those jobs back again .,Republican
we do not want to compete for the wages that are being paid there either  but we can move our people to the top side with education  research and development and technology capital investment .,Republican
they have got to produce more .,Republican
we can do that with technology and a national sales tax  and fix this balance of trade .,Republican
we are on the right track  but we can do more .,Republican
if we go to a national sales tax  we will take america to another destiny yet with our economy .,Republican
mr. speaker  i urge the president 's commission and this congress to take a good look at real tax reform  not tweak it around the edges .,Republican
we have done that .,Republican
we have positioned ourselves well to take america to its next level of destiny  and i am looking forward to the 109th congress for being a part of that .,Republican
mr. chairman  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
i yield to the other gentleman from virginia ( mr.,Republican
goodlatte ) xz4001540 .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time .,Republican
mr. speaker  the amendment in the nature of a substitute completely guts this bill .,Republican
every crippling amendment that was rejected either in this house or the other body in this congress or the previous congress is incorporated in this amendment .,Republican
they do not have any new ideas over there .,Republican
they just repackage and try to regurgitate the old ideas that have been found lacking .,Republican
the issue in this bill is very clear  and that is that we have to restore some sanity to the civil justice system by dealing with the abuses that a small group of lawyers have turned the class action system into .,Republican
when the framers of the constitution wrote that inspired document  they gave congress the power to regulate interstate congress .,Republican
what has happened as a result of the abuse of the class action system is that judges in small out-of-the-way counties  like madison county  illinois and jefferson county  texas end up being the ultimate arbiters of interstate commerce .,Republican
this bill puts some balance back into the system .,Republican
the amendment perpetuates the existing system .,Republican
vote `` no '' on the amendments  vote `` no '' on the motion to recommit  and pass the bill .,Republican
mr. speaker  i yield back the balance of my time .,Republican
